Here's a complete step-by-step explanation and the full solution for the **Look-and-Say Pattern** problem in **Python**, **C++**, and **JavaScript**, with inline comments to explain the logic clearly.

---

### 🔍 **Logic Summary**

* The "look-and-say" sequence is built iteratively:

  * Start from `"1"`
  * Each subsequent number is derived by reading the previous number digit by digit and **saying** how many times each digit appears consecutively.
* Example:

  * `"1"` → "one 1" → `"11"`
  * `"11"` → "two 1s" → `"21"`
  * `"21"` → "one 2, one 1" → `"1211"`
  * ... and so on

### 🧪 Dry Run for `n = 5`

```
1         ← Row 1
11        ← Row 2: one 1
21        ← Row 3: two 1s
1211      ← Row 4: one 2, one 1
111221    ← Row 5: one 1, one 2, two 1s
```

## ✅ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        result = "1"
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            temp = ""
            i = 0
            while i < len(result):
                count = 1
                # Count consecutive identical digits
                while i + 1 < len(result) and result[i] == result[i + 1]:
                    count += 1
                    i += 1
                # Append count and digit to result
                temp += str(count) + result[i]
                i += 1
            result = temp
        return result
```

## ✅ C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string result = "1";
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            string temp = "";
            int j = 0;
            while (j < result.size()) {
                int count = 1;
                // Count identical digits
                while (j + 1 < result.size() && result[j] == result[j + 1]) {
                    ++count;
                    ++j;
                }
                // Append count and digit
                temp += to_string(count) + result[j];
                ++j;
            }
            result = temp;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## ✅ JavaScript Code

```javascript
class Solution {
    countAndSay(n) {
        let result = "1";
        for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            let temp = "";
            let j = 0;
            while (j < result.length) {
                let count = 1;
                // Count occurrences of the same digit
                while (j + 1 < result.length && result[j] === result[j + 1]) {
                    count++;
                    j++;
                }
                temp += count.toString() + result[j];
                j++;
            }
            result = temp;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
