## 🧩 Problem Statement

There are **M job applicants** and **N jobs**.
Each applicant has a subset of jobs that he/she is interested in.

Each job opening can **only accept one applicant**, and each applicant can be **appointed to only one job**.

Given a matrix **G**, where
`G[i][j] = 1` denotes that the *i-th applicant* is interested in the *j-th job*,
find the **maximum number of applicants** who can get jobs such that
as many applicants as possible are matched with available jobs.

---

## 🧠 Example 1

```
Input:
G = {{1,1,0,1,1},{0,1,0,0,1},{1,1,0,1,1}}

Output:
3
```

**Explanation:**
There is one possible assignment:

* First applicant gets the 1st job.
* Second applicant gets the 2nd job.
* Third applicant gets the 3rd job.

Hence, maximum matching = 3.

---

## 🧠 Example 2

```
Input:
G = {{1,1},{0,1},{0,1},{0,1},{1,0}}

Output:
2
```

**Explanation:**
One of the possible assignments:

* First applicant gets the 1st job.
* Second applicant gets the 2nd job.

Hence, maximum matching = 2.

---

## 🎯 Your Task

You don’t need to read or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function:

```python
def maximumMatch(G):
    # code here
```

which takes the matrix **G** as input and returns
the **maximum number of applicants** who can get the job.

Here’s a tight, interview-style guide to **Maximum Bipartite Matching** with a clear walkthrough and two Python solutions (classic DFS augmenting paths and the faster Hopcroft–Karp).

---

## 2) Intuition + Step-by-step dry run

### Model

* Left set = **applicants** (rows `0..M-1`)
* Right set = **jobs** (cols `0..N-1`)
* `G[i][j] == 1` ⇢ applicant *i* is interested in job *j*
* Each applicant gets ≤ 1 job and each job is assigned to ≤ 1 applicant
* Goal: maximize the number of assigned pairs

### Core idea (augmenting paths / Kuhn’s algorithm)

Build the matching incrementally:

* Try to assign each applicant `u`.
* If a job `v` they like is **free**, take it.
* If `v` is taken by applicant `u'`, try to **re-route** `u'` to some other job they like (not yet tried in this DFS), thereby **freeing** `v` for `u`.
* If you can find such an alternating/augmenting path, matching size increases by 1.

This is a standard DFS augmenting path approach.
Typical complexity: **O(V · E)** for bipartite graphs (fits well for `M,N ≤ 100`).

---

### Dry run (on Example 2)

```
G =
[
  [1, 1],   # applicant 0 likes job 0 and 1
  [0, 1],   # applicant 1 likes job 1
  [0, 1],   # applicant 2 likes job 1
  [0, 1],   # applicant 3 likes job 1
  [1, 0]    # applicant 4 likes job 0
]

Start with no jobs assigned: matchR = [-1, -1]    (for jobs 0..1)
count = 0
```

1. Applicant 0:

   * Try job 0 ⇒ free ⇒ assign 0→0
     `matchR = [0, -1]`, `count = 1`

2. Applicant 1:

   * Try job 1 ⇒ free ⇒ assign 1→1
     `matchR = [0, 1]`, `count = 2`

3. Applicant 2:

   * Try job 1 ⇒ taken by 1
   * Try to move applicant 1 elsewhere: its only like is job 1 ⇒ stuck
     ⇒ applicant 2 fails to get a job

4. Applicant 3:

   * Same story as applicant 2 ⇒ fails

5. Applicant 4:

   * Try job 0 ⇒ taken by 0
   * Try to move applicant 0 elsewhere: they also like job 1, but job 1 is taken by 1.
     Try to move 1 elsewhere: no alternative.
     ⇒ applicant 4 fails

Final `count = 2`. ✅

## 3) Optimized Python codes

### A) DFS Augmenting Paths (Kuhn’s algorithm) — “easy & expected”

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumMatch(self, G):
        """
        Kuhn's algorithm (DFS-based augmenting paths).
        M = number of applicants (rows), N = number of jobs (cols)

        Time  : O(V * E)  ~ O(M * M * N) worst-case for dense; fits M,N<=100
        Space : O(N) for matchR + O(N) for visited per DFS
        """
        if not G:
            return 0

        M = len(G)
        N = len(G[0]) if G[0] else 0

        # matchR[v] = the applicant currently matched to job v, or -1 if free
        matchR = [-1] * N

        # Try to assign applicant u by DFS-ing for an augmenting path
        def dfs(u, seen):
            for v in range(N):
                # applicant u is interested in job v and v not visited in this DFS
                if G[u][v] and not seen[v]:
                    seen[v] = True
                    # If job v is free, or we can re-assign the current owner to another job
                    if matchR[v] == -1 or dfs(matchR[v], seen):
                        matchR[v] = u
                        return True
            return False

        result = 0
        for u in range(M):
            seen = [False] * N       # reset per DFS (per applicant)
            if dfs(u, seen):
                result += 1
        return result
```

**Why this works (in one breath during interview):**
We repeatedly search for an **augmenting path** starting from an unmatched applicant. If found, we flip matches along the path, increasing the matching size by 1. Repeating until no augmenting path exists yields a **maximum** matching.

---

### B) Hopcroft–Karp (faster asymptotically, optional)

If the interviewer cares about performance or theory, mention Hopcroft–Karp:

* Groups multiple augmentations per BFS/DFS phase
* Complexity: **O(E · √V)**
  Below is an adjacency-list version (convert matrix to adjacency first):

```python
from collections import deque

class SolutionHopcroftKarp:
    def maximumMatch(self, G):
        """
        Hopcroft–Karp on bipartite graph from matrix G.
        Left side: applicants 0..M-1
        Right side: jobs 0..N-1

        Time  : O(E * sqrt(V))
        Space : O(V + E)
        """
        if not G:
            return 0
        M, N = len(G), len(G[0]) if G[0] else 0

        # Build adjacency list only for edges where G[u][v] == 1
        adj = [[] for _ in range(M)]
        for u in range(M):
            for v in range(N):
                if G[u][v] == 1:
                    adj[u].append(v)

        # Pairing arrays: pairU[u] (left->right), pairV[v] (right->left)
        pairU = [-1] * M
        pairV = [-1] * N
        dist  = [0] * M

        INF = 10**9

        def bfs():
            q = deque()
            for u in range(M):
                if pairU[u] == -1:
                    dist[u] = 0
                    q.append(u)
                else:
                    dist[u] = INF

            found_augmenting_layer = False
            while q:
                u = q.popleft()
                for v in adj[u]:
                    pu = pairV[v]
                    if pu == -1:

                        found_augmenting_layer = True
                    elif dist[pu] == INF:
                        dist[pu] = dist[u] + 1
                        q.append(pu)
            return found_augmenting_layer

        def dfs(u):
            for v in adj[u]:
                pu = pairV[v]
                # Either free on V side or next in layered graph
                if pu == -1 or (dist[pu] == dist[u] + 1 and dfs(pu)):
                    pairU[u] = v
                    pairV[v] = u
                    return True
            dist[u] = INF
            return False

        matching = 0
        while bfs():
            for u in range(M):
                if pairU[u] == -1 and dfs(u):
                    matching += 1
        return matching
```

> In many coding interviews with these constraints, the **DFS augmenting version** is what they expect.

## 4) Interview Q&A (what they usually ask)

**Q1. How do you model this as a graph problem?**
A: As a **bipartite graph**: left nodes are applicants, right nodes are jobs; edges exist where the applicant is interested in the job.

**Q2. What is an augmenting path and why does finding one help?**
A: It’s a path that alternates between unmatched and matched edges, starting and ending at free vertices. Flipping edges along it increases the matching size by 1. If none exists, the current matching is maximum (Berge’s theorem).

**Q3. Complexity of your solution?**
A: DFS augmenting (Kuhn): **O(V·E)**; Hopcroft–Karp: **O(E·√V)**.

**Q4. Why do you need the `seen`/`visited` array in each DFS?**
A: To avoid revisiting the same job in the current DFS attempt, which prevents infinite loops and redundant work.

**Q5. What if an applicant likes no jobs (row of zeros)?**
A: They simply can’t be matched; the algorithm gracefully handles it.

**Q6. Can a greedy “assign first free job you see” be optimal?**
A: No. Greedy fails; you need augmenting paths to rearrange previously made matches for optimality.

**Q7. How would you return the actual assignment (not just count)?**
A: Keep the `matchR` array (job → applicant). After the algorithm, collect `(matchR[j], j)` pairs where `matchR[j] != -1`.

Below is a **complete, runnable Python program** for **Maximum Bipartite Matching** that:

* Implements the classic **DFS Augmenting-Path (Kuhn’s)** algorithm inside the requested class signature.
* Prints the **maximum number matched** and the **actual assignment (applicant → job)**.
* Uses **timeit** to benchmark the average runtime.
* Includes **clear inline comments** showing **time/space complexity** of each step.
* Demonstrates with the two examples from the prompt.

"""
Maximum Bipartite Matching (Applicants ↔ Jobs)
==============================================

We are given a bipartite graph as a 0/1 matrix G of size MxN:
  - Rows   : applicants  (0..M-1)
  - Columns: jobs        (0..N-1)
  - G[i][j] == 1 → applicant i is interested in job j

Goal: Assign as many applicants to distinct jobs as possible.

Approach implemented below:
  Kuhn's algorithm (DFS-based augmenting paths)

Global asymptotics for the solver (per call):
  Time  : O(V * E) for bipartite graphs (fits M,N ≤ 100)
          More concretely for matrix input, worst-case ~ O(M * N * M)
