awesome ‚Äî let‚Äôs make this one airtight for interviews: a crisp intuition + dry run, then two Python solutions in your requested signature (classic BFS and a faster **bidirectional BFS**), with the exact inline comments interviewers like. I‚Äôll wrap with common Q&A.

---

## 2) Intuition & Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Problem recap

* Chessboard is `n √ó n` (1-indexed in the prompt).
* Knight moves in **8 L-shaped** ways: `(¬±1, ¬±2)` and `(¬±2, ¬±1)`.
* Find the **minimum** moves to go from `knightPos` to `targetPos`.

### Why BFS?

Each move has the **same cost** (1). On an unweighted graph (cells are nodes; edges are knight moves), **BFS** from the source returns the **shortest path length** in layers.

### Dry run (Example 2)

```
n = 6
knightPos = [4, 5]
targetPos = [1, 1]
```

* Start at `(4,5)`; distance = 0.
* All 8 knight moves that stay inside the board are enqueued at distance 1. Two useful neighbors: `(5,3)`, `(2,4)`, etc.
* From `(5,3)` (dist 1), we expand: one child is `(3,2)` (dist 2).
* From `(3,2)` (dist 2), we expand: one child is `(1,1)` (dist 3) ‚Üí reached target.
  So answer = **3**. One shortest path:
  `(4,5) ‚Üí (5,3) ‚Üí (3,2) ‚Üí (1,1)`.

---

## 3) Optimized Codes (two ways)

### A) Standard BFS (what interviewers expect)

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minStepToReachTarget(self, knightPos, targetPos, n):
        """
        Classic BFS on an unweighted grid graph.
        - State: (r, c)
        - Start: knightPos
        - Goal:  targetPos
        - Edges: 8 knight moves inside [1..n] √ó [1..n]
        
        Time  : O(n^2) in worst case (every cell visited once)
        Space : O(n^2) for visited + queue
        """
        sr, sc = knightPos
        tr, tc = targetPos
        
        # Trivial case
        if (sr, sc) == (tr, tc):
            return 0
        
        # 8 knight moves
        moves = [(+1, +2), (+1, -2), (-1, +2), (-1, -2),
                 (+2, +1), (+2, -1), (-2, +1), (-2, -1)]
        
        # visited as a boolean grid (1-based indexing convenient here)
        visited = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        q = deque()
        q.append((sr, sc, 0))      # (row, col, steps)
        visited[sr][sc] = True
        
        while q:
            r, c, d = q.popleft()
            # expand neighbors
            for dr, dc in moves:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 1 <= nr <= n and 1 <= nc <= n and not visited[nr][nc]:
                    if (nr, nc) == (tr, tc):
                        return d + 1
                    visited[nr][nc] = True
                    q.append((nr, nc, d + 1))
        
        # For completeness; a knight on a finite board always reaches any square.
        return -1
```

### B) Bidirectional BFS (reduces search dramatically when n is large)

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minStepToReachTarget(self, knightPos, targetPos, n):
        """

        Space : O(n^2) for visited/frontiers

        # visited maps store distance from their respective sides
        vis_s = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        vis_t = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        qt = deque([(tr, tc)])

        def expand(q, vis_self, vis_other):
            """Expand one level from one side; return total distance if frontiers meet."""
            for _ in range(len(q)):

                        # If the other side has already visited this cell, we met!
                        if vis_other[nr][nc] != -1:
                            return vis_self[nr][nc] + vis_other[nr][nc]
                        q.append((nr, nc))
            return None
        
        while qs and qt:
            # Expand the smaller frontier first (heuristic)

                meet = expand(qs, vis_s, vis_t)
            else:

            if meet is not None:
                return meet
        
        return -1  # should not happen on a valid board
```

> Both versions accept 1-based coordinates as in the prompt. If you prefer 0-based, just shift by ‚àí1 and adjust bounds.

## 4) Interview Q&A (high-yield)

**Q1. Why is BFS optimal here?**
Edges all have equal weight (1 move). In unweighted graphs, BFS discovers vertices in **increasing distance layers**, guaranteeing the first time you see the target is the shortest path.

**Q2. Time and space complexity?**

* BFS: visits each cell at most once ‚Üí **O(n¬≤)** time and space.
* Bidirectional BFS: same big-O worst case, but typically explores about ( b^{d/2} ) states from each side instead of ( b^d ) (where ( b ) is branching, ( d ) is distance) ‚Äî often much faster.

**Q3. Are there unreachable cases?**
On an empty ( n \times n ) board, a knight can reach any square from any other square for ( n \ge 2 ). (For ( n=1 ), only one cell, trivial.) The `-1` return is defensive.

**Q4. Do we need Dijkstra/A*?**
No. All moves cost 1, so BFS suffices. A* needs a consistent heuristic; there‚Äôs no simple admissible heuristic that substantially outperforms BFS here.

**Q5. Why 1-based indexing in code?**
The prompt uses 1-based `(row, col)`. Keeping 1-based avoids off-by-one errors. Converting to 0-based is also fine.

**Q6. Any micro-optimizations?**

* Expand the **smaller frontier first** in bidirectional BFS.
* Precompute valid moves or use a local tuple list (as shown) to avoid reallocations.

**Q7. Path reconstruction?**
Not required here (only minimum steps). If asked, store parents (`parent[r][c]`) and backtrack after reaching the target.

---

here‚Äôs a **runnable, interview-style full program** for **Steps by Knight** with:

* two implementations: **BFS** (canonical) and **Bidirectional BFS** (faster in practice),
* dense inline **time/space complexity** notes where they matter,
* a tiny **driver** that prints inputs & outputs,
* and **timeit** micro-benchmarks comparing both variants.

I finish with a handful of **important real-world use cases**.

## 5) Full Python Program (with inline complexity comments + timings)

```python
"""
Steps by Knight (minimum knight moves on an n x n chessboard)

We implement:
  A) BFS (canonical shortest path in unweighted graphs)
     - Time  : O(n^2) in the worst case (each cell visited once)
     - Space : O(n^2) for visited + queue

  B) Bidirectional BFS (search from start and target simultaneously)
     - Same worst-case O(n^2) space/time, but typically ~O(b^(d/2)) nodes
       from each side instead of O(b^d) for standard BFS (b‚âà6 average branching,
       d = shortest distance), hence much faster in practice on large boards.

Driver:
  - Runs the two examples from the prompt and a couple of extra tests.
  - Benchmarks both approaches with timeit.

### What you‚Äôll see

* Example 1 prints `1`; Example 2 prints `3`.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (the important ones)

1. **Robot motion on grid with discrete moves**
   When a robot/tool has movement constraints akin to ‚Äúknight-like‚Äù jumps, shortest-move planning uses **BFS** in an unweighted move graph.

2. **Game AI pathfinding (unweighted state graphs)**
   Many board games (knight tours, puzzles) map to unweighted graphs where **BFS gives optimal move counts**; **bi-BFS** reduces turnaround in real-time AI.

3. **Network/graph reachability with uniform costs**
   When every transition has equal cost (e.g., hop count), minimal-hop routing or state-space exploration uses **BFS**; bi-BFS accelerates queries.

4. **Interactive puzzle solvers & tutoring tools**
   Teaching shortest-path concepts with knight moves is common; these implementations are the **canonical references**.
