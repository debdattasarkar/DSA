## üìò Problem Statement

Given a grid of size **n √ó m** consisting of **'O'**s and **'X'**s, the task is to find the number of **'X' total shapes**.

> **Note:**
> An **'X' shape** consists of one or more adjacent 'X's connected either **vertically** or **horizontally** (but not diagonally).

---

## üß† Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input:
grid = {{X, O, X},
        {O, X, O},
        {X, X, X}}

Output:
3
```

**Explanation:**
The grid is:

```
X O X
O X O
X X X
```

* The 'X's with the same colour are adjacent either vertically or horizontally (diagonals not included).
* Hence, there are **3 distinct X groups** in the grid.

---

### Example 2:

```
Input:
grid = {{X, X},
        {X, X}}

Output:
1
```

**Explanation:**
The grid is:

```
X X
X X
```

* Here, all 'X's are connected either vertically or horizontally.
* Therefore, there is **only 1 group** of 'X' shapes.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Your Task

You don‚Äôt need to read input or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function:

```python
def xShape(self, grid):
    # code here
```

which takes the **grid** as input and returns the **count of total 'X' shapes**.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** O(n √ó m)
* **Space Complexity:** O(n √ó m)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

```

## 2) Idea + step-by-step dry run

### Problem in one line

Count how many **4-connected** (up/down/left/right) groups of `'X'` exist in an `n √ó m` grid of `'X'` and `'O'`. Diagonals do **not** connect.

### Core insight

It‚Äôs exactly the number of **connected components** of cells labeled `'X'` when connectivity is 4-directional.
Scan the grid; whenever you see an unvisited `'X'`, that starts a **new shape**. Do a flood-fill (DFS/BFS) to mark the whole component as visited so you don‚Äôt count it again.

### Dry run (Example-1)

Grid:

```
X O X
O X O
X X X
```

Index with (r,c) from (0,0).

* Start (0,0) = 'X' & unvisited ‚Üí shape **#1**.
  Flood-fill reaches only (0,0). (Neighbors: (1,0)='O', (0,1)='O')
* (0,1)='O' ‚Üí skip.
* (0,2)='X' & unvisited ‚Üí shape **#2**.
  Flood-fill reaches only (0,2). (Neighbors: (1,2)='O', (0,1)='O')
* Next row:
  (1,0)='O' skip, (1,1)='X' & unvisited ‚Üí shape **#3**.
  Flood-fill from (1,1) reaches: (1,1) ‚Üí (2,1) ‚Üí (2,0) ‚Üí (2,2).
  (Check their neighbors too, they‚Äôre either already visited or 'O'.)
* Remaining cells are visited or 'O'.

Total shapes = **3** ‚úÖ

Complexities:

* Time `O(n*m)`: each cell is visited at most once.
* Extra space: `O(n*m)` for `visited` (or `O(1)` if you mutate the grid).

---

## 3) Python solutions (interview-ready)

### A) Standard DFS (recursive) ‚Äî clean & expected

```python
class Solution:
    
    # Function to find the number of 'X' total shapes.
    # Time:  O(n*m)
    # Space: O(n*m) worst-case due to recursion stack + visited
    def xShape(self, grid):
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = [[False]*m for _ in range(n)]
        
        # 4-directional moves (no diagonals)
        DIRS = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
        
        def dfs(r, c):
            # Mark (r,c) as visited and expand to 4-neighbors that are 'X'
            visited[r][c] = True
            for dr, dc in DIRS:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m:
                    if grid[nr][nc] == 'X' and not visited[nr][nc]:
                        dfs(nr, nc)
        
        count = 0
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(m):
                if grid[r][c] == 'X' and not visited[r][c]:
                    count += 1        # new component found
                    dfs(r, c)         # flood-fill the entire shape
        return count
```

**Why this is great for interviews:** minimal code, clear logic, matches the standard ‚Äúcount islands‚Äù pattern (with 4-dir).

---

### B) BFS (iterative, avoids recursion depth)

```python
from collections import deque

class SolutionBFS:
    # Time:  O(n*m)
    # Space: O(n*m)
    def xShape(self, grid):
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = [[False]*m for _ in range(n)]
        DIRS = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
        
        def bfs(sr, sc):
            q = deque([(sr, sc)])
            visited[sr][sc] = True
            while q:
                r, c = q.popleft()
                for dr, dc in DIRS:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m:
                        if grid[nr][nc] == 'X' and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            q.append((nr, nc))
        
        count = 0
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(m):
                if grid[r][c] == 'X' and not visited[r][c]:
                    count += 1
                    bfs(r, c)
        return count
```

**When to use:** If interviewer brings up recursion limits / stack safety, switch to BFS.

### C) Union‚ÄìFind / DSU (alternative) ‚Äî good for DSU discussions

```python
class SolutionDSU:
    # Time:  O(n*m * Œ±(n*m)) ~ O(n*m)
    # Space: O(n*m)
    def xShape(self, grid):
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # Map (r,c) -> id in [0..n*m-1]
        def idx(r, c): return r*m + c
        
        parent = list(range(n*m))
        rank   = [0]*(n*m)
        
        def find(x):
            while parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = parent[parent[x]]
                x = parent[x]
            return x
        
        def union(a, b):
            ra, rb = find(a), find(b)
            if ra == rb: return
            if rank[ra] < rank[rb]:
                parent[ra] = rb
            elif rank[ra] > rank[rb]:
                parent[rb] = ra
            else:
                parent[rb] = ra
                rank[ra] += 1
        
        # Union adjacent 'X' cells (4-directional)
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(m):
                if grid[r][c] != 'X': 
                    continue
                id1 = idx(r, c)
                if r+1 < n and grid[r+1][c] == 'X':
                    union(id1, idx(r+1, c))
                if c+1 < m and grid[r][c+1] == 'X':
                    union(id1, idx(r, c+1))
        
        # Count distinct roots among 'X' cells
        roots = set()
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(m):
                if grid[r][c] == 'X':
                    roots.add(find(idx(r, c)))
        return len(roots)
```

**When to use:** If interviewer asks for a DSU approach or when you expect many union/find queries.

## 4) Interview Q&A (most asked)

**Q1. Why not count diagonal neighbors?**
The problem explicitly defines shape connectivity as **vertical and horizontal only**. Including diagonals would change the answer.

**Q2. Time and space complexity?**
Both DFS and BFS visit each cell at most once ‚Üí **Time `O(n*m)`**, **Space `O(n*m)`** (visited + recursion/BFS queue). DSU is effectively `O(n*m)` too.

**Q3. Can we do it in `O(1)` extra space?**
Yes, if mutation is allowed: mark visited `'X'` cells as `'O'` during flood-fill (in-place). That reduces auxiliary space to `O(1)` (barring recursion stack).

**Q4. What if recursion depth is a concern?**
Use the **BFS** version (or iterative DFS with a Python list as a stack).

**Q5. How to generalize to 8-direction connectivity?**
Change the neighbor set to include diagonal deltas:
`[(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)]`.

**Q6. What edge cases should we test?**

* All `'O'` ‚Üí result `0`.
* Single `'X'` ‚Üí result `1`.
* One long snake of `'X'` ‚Üí result `1`.
* Checkerboard of `'X'`/`'O'` ‚Üí many single-cell shapes.

**Q7. Why does scanning + flood-fill work?**
Because each unvisited `'X'` cell starts a **new connected component**; the flood-fill marks the entire component visited so we count it exactly once.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (why this matters)

1. **Image segmentation (binary masks):**
   Counting connected components of foreground pixels (e.g., lesions, objects) when connectivity is 4-neighborhood.

2. **Map/terrain analysis:**
   Detecting contiguous land patches in a binary water/land raster (diagonals often excluded for conservative adjacency).

3. **Document processing / OCR:**
   Identifying connected blobs of ink (characters or components) in binarized images using 4-connectivity.

4. **Game mechanics on grids:**
   Regions capture, flood-fill tools, and puzzle detection (e.g., ‚Äúpaint bucket‚Äù or ‚Äúisland‚Äù puzzles).
