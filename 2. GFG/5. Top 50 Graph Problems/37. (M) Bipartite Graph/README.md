Given a graph with **V** vertices (numbered from **0 to V-1**) and **E** edges, check whether the graph is **bipartite** or not.

A **bipartite graph** can be colored with two colors such that **no two adjacent vertices share the same color**. This means we can divide the graph‚Äôs vertices into two distinct sets where:

* All edges connect vertices from one set to vertices in the other set.
* No edges exist between vertices within the same set.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `V = 3`, `edges[][] = [[0, 1], [1,2]]`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** The given graph can be colored in two colors, so it is a bipartite graph.

### Example 2

**Input:** `V = 4`, `edges[][] = [[0, 3], [1, 2], [3, 2], [0, 2]]`
**Output:** `false`
**Explanation:** The given graph **cannot** be colored in two colors such that the color of adjacent vertices differs. Hence, it is **not** bipartite.

---

## Constraints

* `1 ‚â§ V ‚â§ 2 * 10^5`
* `1 ‚â§ edges.size() ‚â§ 10^5`
* `1 ‚â§ edges[i][j] ‚â§ 10^5`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(V)`

## 2) Explanation + step-by-step dry run

**Idea:**
A graph is bipartite if you can 2-color its vertices so that no edge has the same color on both ends.
We can try to color each connected component using **BFS or DFS**:

* Uncolored start node ‚Üí color `0`.
* Every neighbor must get `1 - color[u]`.
* If we ever see an edge `(u,v)` with `color[u] == color[v]`, the graph is **not** bipartite.

We must also handle **disconnected graphs**: run BFS/DFS from every uncolored node.

### Dry run 1 (bipartite)

`V=3, edges=[[0,1],[1,2]]`

1. Build adjacency: `0:[1], 1:[0,2], 2:[1]`.
2. Start at `0`: color[0]=0.
   Neigh 1 ‚Üí color[1]=1.
   From 1: neigh 0 already 0 (OK), neigh 2 ‚Üí color[2]=0.
3. From 2: neigh 1 already 1 (OK).
   No conflicts ‚Üí **bipartite** (True).

### Dry run 2 (not bipartite)

`V=4, edges=[[0,3],[1,2],[3,2],[0,2]]` (triangle 0‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì0)

1. Adj: `0:[3,2], 1:[2], 2:[1,3,0], 3:[0,2]`.
2. Start at `0`: color[0]=0.
   Visit 3 ‚Üí color[3]=1. Visit 2 ‚Üí color[2]=1.
3. Process 3: neigh 2 has color 1 (same as 3) ‚Üí **conflict** ‚Üí **not** bipartite (False).

**Edge cases:**

* **Self loop** `(u,u)` ‚áí immediately not bipartite.
* **Multiple edges** are fine (just recheck same constraint).
* **Isolated vertices** are fine (each is a trivial component).

## 3) Optimized Python solutions (with interview-style inline comments)

### A) BFS 2-coloring (iterative, stack-safe) ‚Äî recommended

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, V, edges):
        # Build adjacency list; O(V + E)
        adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]
        for u, v in edges:
            if u == v:               # self-loop => cannot be bipartite
                return False
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)
        
        color = [-1] * V             # -1 = uncolored; 0/1 are the two colors
        
        for s in range(V):           # cover disconnected graphs
            if color[s] != -1:
                continue
            # BFS from s
            color[s] = 0
            q = deque([s])
            while q:
                u = q.popleft()
                for w in adj[u]:
                    if color[w] == -1:
                        color[w] = color[u] ^ 1  # opposite color
                        q.append(w)
                    elif color[w] == color[u]:
                        return False             # conflict
        return True                               # all components colored without conflicts
```

**Time:** `O(V + E)`
**Space:** `O(V)` (colors + queue)

---

### B) DFS 2-coloring (recursive, concise)

```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, V, edges):
        adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]
        for u, v in edges:
            if u == v:
                return False
            adj[u].append(v); adj[v].append(u)
        
        color = [-1] * V
        
        def dfs(u, c):
            color[u] = c
            for w in adj[u]:
                if color[w] == -1:
                    if not dfs(w, c ^ 1):   # color neighbor opposite
                        return False
                elif color[w] == c:
                    return False            # conflict
            return True
        
        for s in range(V):
            if color[s] == -1:
                if not dfs(s, 0):
                    return False
        return True
```

**Time:** `O(V + E)`
**Space:** `O(V)` (color + recursion stack; beware deep recursion on big graphs)

### C) Union-Find with ‚Äúopposite set‚Äù trick (no graph traversal)

Use 2N nodes: for each vertex `u`, track `u` and `u+V` meaning ‚Äúopposite set of u‚Äù.
For edge `(u,v)`: enforce `u` with `v+V` and `v` with `u+V`. If `find(u) == find(u+V)` for any `u`, not bipartite.

```python
class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, V, edges):
        # parent/rank over 2*V nodes
        parent = list(range(2 * V))
        rank = [0] * (2 * V)
        
        def find(x):
            # path-compressed find
            while parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = parent[parent[x]]
                x = parent[x]
            return x
        
        def union(a, b):
            ra, rb = find(a), find(b)
            if ra == rb:
                return
            if rank[ra] < rank[rb]:
                ra, rb = rb, ra
            parent[rb] = ra
            if rank[ra] == rank[rb]:
                rank[ra] += 1
        
        for u, v in edges:
            if u == v:                 # self-loop => not bipartite
                return False
            # u with opposite of v, v with opposite of u
            union(u, v + V)
            union(v, u + V)
            # immediate contradiction check is optional; final check covers it
            if find(u) == find(u + V) or find(v) == find(v + V):
                return False
        
        # Final consistency check
        for u in range(V):
            if find(u) == find(u + V):
                return False
        return True
```

**Time:** ~`O((V + E) Œ±(2V))` (Œ± = inverse Ackermann, practically constant)
**Space:** `O(V)`.

> Interview tip: BFS/DFS is the most expected. DSU solution is a nice alternative when asked to ‚Äúavoid recursion/queues‚Äù or when constraints push for a union-find approach.

## 4) Likely Interview Q&A

**Q1. Why does 2-coloring detect bipartiteness?**
A1. A graph is bipartite iff it has **no odd cycle**. BFS/DFS alternates colors layer by layer; an odd cycle forces a same-color edge, which we detect as a conflict.

**Q2. How do you handle disconnected graphs?**
A2. Loop through all vertices; if a vertex is uncolored, start a BFS/DFS from it.

**Q3. What about self loops or multiple edges?**
A3. A self loop `(u,u)` instantly violates bipartiteness. Multiple edges don‚Äôt change the result (they just recheck the same constraint).

**Q4. Space/time complexity?**
A4. Both BFS and DFS are `O(V+E)` time and `O(V)` space. DSU is ~`O((V+E) Œ±(V))` time, `O(V)` space.

**Q5. When would you prefer DSU?**
A5. When you want an iterative approach without graph traversal stacks/queues, or you‚Äôre already using DSU for other constraints so it integrates naturally.

**Q6. Does this work for directed graphs?**
A6. No‚Äîbipartiteness is defined for undirected graphs. For directed graphs you might be checking for 2-colorability of the underlying undirected version or solving a different property.

**Q7. What if recursion depth is a concern?**
A7. Use the **BFS** version to avoid recursion, or implement iterative DFS.

**Q8. Can you return the two sets as well?**
A8. Yes. After successful coloring, vertices with color `0` form set A, and color `1` form set B.

Below is a **complete, runnable Python program** that:

* Implements the **BFS 2-coloring** solution (most expected in interviews).
* Includes **inline comments** that note the **time & space complexity** of each relevant step.
* Shows **sample inputs** (both bipartite and non-bipartite), **prints outputs**, and uses `time.perf_counter()` to measure elapsed time for the full run.

```python
"""
Bipartite Graph Check ‚Äî Full Program (BFS 2-coloring)

Approach:
- Build adjacency list O(V + E) time, O(V + E) space (dominated by edges storage).
- For each uncolored node, run BFS and color neighbors with opposite color.
- If we ever find an edge whose endpoints have the same color -> not bipartite.

Why BFS? Iterative (stack-safe), clean, and O(V+E) ‚Äî exactly what interviewers expect.

## Complexity Summary (BFS approach)

* **Building adjacency list:** `O(V + E)` time, `O(V + E)` space
* **BFS over all components:** `O(V + E)` time, `O(V)` extra space for colors + queue
* **Overall:** `O(V + E)` time, `O(V + E)` space (dominated by adjacency list)

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few critical ones)

1. **Scheduling with two alternating slots/teams**
   Assign tasks/people to one of two groups where conflicts (edges) mean ‚Äúcan‚Äôt share the same slot/team.‚Äù

2. **Two-coloring social graphs**
   Separate users into two communities when edges denote rivalry/incompatibility; bipartiteness ensures no intra-group conflicts.

3. **Bipartite validation before matching**
   Many algorithms (e.g., maximum bipartite matching / assignment) require the graph to be bipartite. This check guards correctness early.

4. **Circuit design & netlist partitioning**
   Validate whether a set of components/wires can be partitioned into two layers without crossing constraints (approximate modeling).
