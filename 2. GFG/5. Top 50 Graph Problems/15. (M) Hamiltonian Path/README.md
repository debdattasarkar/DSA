### üß≠ Summary

This problem focuses on identifying whether a Hamiltonian Path exists in an undirected graph ‚Äî a path that visits **every vertex exactly once** without repetition. It uses **Depth First Search (DFS)** and **Backtracking** to explore all possible paths, marking visited nodes and backtracking when dead ends are encountered.

The brute force approach explores all possible vertex permutations (O(n!)), which is acceptable given the small constraint (`n ‚â§ 10`).

awesome ‚Äî let‚Äôs make this interview-ready: clear intuition + a tiny dry run, then two Python solutions in your requested signature:

1. Backtracking/DFS (what interviewers expect first)
2. Bitmask DP over subsets (clean, optimal for n‚â§20; here n‚â§10 so it flies)

I‚Äôll wrap with high-yield Q&A.

## 2) Intuition & Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Problem recap

We‚Äôre given an **undirected** graph (`n` vertices labeled 1..n). A **Hamiltonian path** visits **every vertex exactly once**. We only need to tell if **there exists** such a path (return `1`) or not (`0`).

### Key approaches

* **Backtracking (DFS over permutations with pruning):**
  Try each vertex as a start; extend the path by walking to an unvisited neighbor; backtrack when stuck. With `n ‚â§ 10`, this is fine.
* **Bitmask DP (subset DP):**
  `dp[mask][v] = True` if there is a path that visits exactly the set `mask` and **ends** at `v`.
  Transition: `dp[mask | (1<<v)][v] |= dp[mask][u]` when there‚Äôs an edge `u‚Äîv`.
  If any `dp[(1<<n)-1][v]` is True ‚Üí Hamiltonian path exists.

### Dry run (Example 1)

```
n=4, edges: (1-2),(2-3),(3-4),(2-4)
Adj:
1: [2]
2: [1,3,4]
3: [2,4]
4: [2,3]
```

Backtracking from `1`:

* path = [1], visit neighbor 2
* path = [1,2], try neighbor 3
* path = [1,2,3], try neighbor 4 ‚Üí success (length=4).
  Hence answer `1`.

On DP:

* Initialize `dp[1<<i][i]=True` for all i.
* Grow masks; ultimately `dp[1111][v]` becomes True (e.g., end at 4), so answer `1`.

---

## 3) Python ‚Äî Optimized Codes (brute/backtracking + DP)

Return `1` if a Hamiltonian path exists, else `0`.

### A) Backtracking (DFS) ‚Äî interview staple

```python
# User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def check(self, n, m, edges):
        """
        Backtracking over path endpoints.
        Build adjacency list. For each start node, DFS picking unvisited neighbors.
        
        Time  : O(n! ) worst-case, but n ‚â§ 10 so it's fine; heavy pruning from adjacency.
        Space : O(n + m) for graph + O(n) recursion stack + O(n) visited.
        """
        # Build 0-based adjacency
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:
            u -= 1; v -= 1
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)

        # Quick pruning: if any isolated vertex and n>1 -> impossible
        if n > 1 and any(len(adj[i]) == 0 for i in range(n)):
            return 0

        visited = [False] * n

        def dfs(u, depth):
            """Return True if we can build a path of length 'depth' ending at u."""
            if depth == n:                      # visited all vertices exactly once
                return True
            # Try unvisited neighbors
            for v in adj[u]:
                if not visited[v]:
                    visited[v] = True
                    if dfs(v, depth + 1):
                        return True
                    visited[v] = False
            return False

        # Try each vertex as a starting point
        for s in range(n):
            visited[s] = True
            if dfs(s, 1):
                return 1
            visited[s] = False
        return 0
```

#### Why this works (what to say)

* We enumerate simple paths by DFS while enforcing ‚Äúvisit once‚Äù with `visited`.
* We stop as soon as path length reaches `n`.
* Complexity is exponential in worst case, but `n ‚â§ 10` ‚Üí fast.

### B) Bitmask DP over subsets ‚Äî neat, scalable to ~20 nodes

```python
# User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def check(self, n, m, edges):
        """
        Subset DP: dp[mask][v] == 1 if there's a path visiting exactly 'mask' and ending at vertex v.
        Transition: from any u in mask with edge u-v, set dp[mask|1<<v][v] |= dp[mask][u].

        Time  : O(n * 2^n + m * 2^n)   (here n ‚â§ 10 ‚Üí ~10k states * small factor)
        Space : O(n * 2^n)
        """
        # Build adjacency bitmasks for quicker transitions
        adj = [0] * n
        for u, v in edges:
            u -= 1; v -= 1
            adj[u] |= (1 << v)
            adj[v] |= (1 << u)

        ALL = (1 << n) - 1
        # dp[mask][v] as booleans; use list of ints for speed
        dp = [ [0]*n for _ in range(1 << n) ]

        # Initialize: single-vertex paths
        for v in range(n):
            dp[1 << v][v] = 1

        # Iterate over masks, grow by one vertex each step
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            # speed: skip masks with no bits (but 0 not used anyway)
            for v in range(n):
                if dp[mask][v] == 0:
                    continue
                # we are at 'v' having visited 'mask'; try to add a neighbor 'w'
                # candidate neighbors are those adjacent to v and not yet in mask
                nxt = adj[v] & ~mask
                w = nxt
                while w:
                    lsb = w & -w
                    w_idx = (lsb.bit_length() - 1)
                    dp[mask | (1 << w_idx)][w_idx] = 1
                    w -= lsb

        # If any full-mask state exists, we have a Hamiltonian path
        for v in range(n):
            if dp[ALL][v]:
                return 1
        return 0
```

#### Notes you can say

* `dp[mask][v]` compactly encodes all partial endpoints; we don‚Äôt store order, only reachability.
* Space/time are `Œò(n¬∑2^n)` which is perfect here.

## 4) Interview Q&A (high-yield)

**Q1. Difference between Hamiltonian path and Eulerian path?**

* **Hamiltonian**: visits **each vertex** exactly once (NP-complete in general).
* **Eulerian**: uses **each edge** exactly once (linear-time characterizations via degree/connectivity).

**Q2. Why is backtracking acceptable here?**
Constraints are tiny (`n ‚â§ 10`). Worst case `O(n!)` is still manageable, and adjacency pruning helps a lot.

**Q3. How does the `*bitmask DP*` work?**
We store whether any path visits a set of vertices `mask` and **ends at** vertex `v`. We extend by one neighbor at a time. If any state reaches `mask = (1<<n)-1`, a Hamiltonian path exists.

**Q4. Can we reconstruct the path with DP?**
Yes ‚Äî store a `parent[mask][v] = u` when you set `dp[mask][v] = True`. Backtrack from any `dp[ALL][v]`.

**Q5. Common pruning ideas for the backtracking?**

* Early return if a vertex has degree `0` (and `n>1`).
* Order next neighbors by smaller degree first (heuristic).
* Start from vertices with extreme degree (sometimes prunes faster).

**Q6. Why 0-based vs 1-based nodes in code?**
Input labels are 1..n; internally we convert to 0..n-1 for array indexing.

**Q7. Could we use BFS/DFS to detect Hamiltonicity directly?**
No; plain DFS/BFS only tests reachability, not the ‚Äúexactly once‚Äù constraint. You need backtracking or subset DP.

**Q8. Complexity of bitmask DP here?**
`O(n¬∑2^n + m¬∑2^n)` time, `O(n¬∑2^n)` space. With `n=10`, that‚Äôs at most ~10,240 states * small factor ‚Üí fast.

awesome ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **runnable, interview-style full program** for **Hamiltonian Path** with:

* two implementations (Backtracking DFS and Bitmask DP),
* rich **inline time/space complexity** notes right where they matter,
* a tiny **driver** that prints **inputs & outputs**, and
* **timeit** micro-benchmarks comparing both approaches on small graphs.

I finish with a few crisp **real-world use cases**.

We include two approaches:

A) Backtracking DFS (interview staple)
   - Try every vertex as a start; recursively visit an unvisited neighbor and backtrack.
   - Time  : O(n!) worst-case (n <= 10 is fine), but heavily pruned by degrees.
   - Space : O(n + m) for graph + O(n) recursion + O(n) visited.

B) Bitmask DP over subsets (optimal for n up to ~20)
   - dp[mask][v] = 1 if there exists a path that visits exactly vertices in 'mask'
     and ends at vertex v.
   - Transition: for any u in mask with edge u-v, dp[mask | 1<<v][v] |= dp[mask][u]

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (the important ones)

1. **Scheduling/Sequencing with Visit-Exactly-Once Constraints**
   Visiting each workstation/room/inspection point exactly once ‚Äî e.g., manufacturing or facility audits ‚Äî when order feasibility matters more than distance optimality.

2. **Puzzle/Path Games & Tour Problems**
   Checking if a given graph puzzle allows a single sweep visiting each node exactly once (variations of ‚Äúfind a path touching every tile once‚Äù).

3. **Compiler/Register Allocation Heuristics (toy models)**
   Some heuristics explore permutations of items with pairwise constraints; Hamiltonian feasibility shows whether a full traversal order exists.

4. **Bioinformatics (toy graph models)**
   Validating whether a path exists that visits each unique feature/node exactly once in simplified assembly/annotation graphs.
