## üß© Problem Description

A **critical connection** refers to an edge that, upon removal, will make it impossible for certain nodes to reach each other through any path.

You are given an **undirected connected graph** with `v` vertices and `e` edges, where each vertex is distinct and ranges from `0` to `v-1`.
You need to find all **critical connections** (also known as **bridges**) in the graph.

It is ensured that there is at least one such edge present.

> **Note:** Return the connections in **sorted order**.

---

## üß† Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
v = 3
Edges:
0 - 1
1 - 2
2 - 0
```

**Output:**

```
0 1
0 2
```

**Explanation:**
On removing edge `(0, 1)`, you will not be able to reach node `0` and `2` from node `1`.
Similarly, removing edge `(0, 2)` disconnects `0` and `1` from node `2`.

Hence, both `(0, 1)` and `(0, 2)` are critical connections.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
v = 4
Edges:
0 - 1
1 - 2
2 - 0
2 - 3
```

**Output:**

```
2 3
```

**Explanation:**
The edge between nodes `2` and `3` is the only **Critical Connection** in the given graph.
Removing it will isolate node `3` from the rest of the graph.

# 2) Intuition + Step-by-step dry run

## What is a ‚Äúcritical connection / bridge‚Äù?

An edge `(u, v)` in an **undirected** graph is a **bridge** if removing it increases the number of connected components (i.e., `u` and `v` can no longer reach each other through any path).

## Key idea (Tarjan‚Äôs bridge algorithm)

Run a single DFS keeping two timestamps for each node:

* `disc[u]`: time we **discover** `u` (DFS entry time)
* `low[u]`: the **lowest** discovery time reachable from `u` via **any** path consisting of

  * any number of tree edges (DFS edges downwards) followed by
  * at most one back edge (edge to an ancestor)

During DFS over an undirected graph:

* When we traverse a **tree edge** `u -> v` (i.e., `v` not visited yet), after finishing `v`‚Äôs DFS we update
  `low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])`.
* When we see a **back edge** `u -> w` where `w != parent[u]` and `w` is **already discovered**,
  `low[u] = min(low[u], disc[w])`.

**Bridge test:**
A tree edge `(u, v)` is a bridge iff `low[v] > disc[u]`.
(If `v` cannot reach `u` or any ancestor of `u` via back edges, removing `(u, v)` disconnects.)

### Dry run on example

Graph: `0-1, 1-2, 2-0, 2-3` (triangle plus a tail). Expected bridges: `(2, 3)`.

Let‚Äôs start DFS at `0`. Timestamps increase 1,2,3,‚Ä¶

```
time=1
visit 0: disc[0]=1, low[0]=1
  go to 1 (tree edge)
  visit 1: disc[1]=2, low[1]=2
    go to 2 (tree edge)
    visit 2: disc[2]=3, low[2]=3
      neighbor 0 is visited and not parent -> back edge
      low[2] = min(3, disc[0]=1) = 1
      neighbor 1 is parent -> ignore
      go to 3 (tree edge)
      visit 3: disc[3]=4, low[3]=4
        neighbor 2 is parent -> ignore
      backtrack to 2:
        low[2] = min(low[2]=1, low[3]=4) = 1
        Check edge (2,3): low[3]=4 > disc[2]=3 => **bridge (2,3)**
    backtrack to 1:
      low[1] = min(low[1]=2, low[2]=1) = 1
      Check edge (1,2): low[2]=1 > disc[1]=2 ? No => not a bridge
  backtrack to 0:
    low[0] = min(low[0]=1, low[1]=1) = 1
    Check edge (0,1): low[1]=1 > disc[0]=1 ? No => not a bridge
DFS done. Bridges = {(2,3)}.
```

# 3) Optimized codes (two approaches)

## A) Optimal (Tarjan‚Äôs DFS, O(V+E))

* Single DFS pass.
* Works even if the graph isn‚Äôt strictly connected (we start DFS from every unvisited node).
* Return edges in **sorted order** with smaller endpoint first and the list lexicographically sorted.

        import sys

        time = 0

                dfs(u)

        # Sort output as required
        bridges.sort()
        return bridges

### Complexity

* **Time:** `O(V + E)` ‚Äî each edge is explored at most twice (undirected).
* **Space:** `O(V)` for recursion stack and arrays.

## B) ‚ÄúBrute but clear‚Äù (remove-an-edge & check connectivity, O(E¬∑(V+E)))

For each edge `(u, w)`:

1. Temporarily remove it.
2. Run a BFS/DFS from `0` (or from `u`) to see if the graph is still connected.
3. If not, it‚Äôs a bridge.
4. Restore the edge.

This is simple but much slower.

    def criticalConnections(self, v, adj):
        """
        Slow/reference approach for clarity.

        for u in range(v):
            for w in adj[u]:
                if u < w:
                    edges.add((u, w))

        # Use adjacency sets for O(1) removal/add
        S = [set(nei) for nei in adj]

        def is_connected_after_removal(a, b):
            # Temporarily remove edge a-b

            seen = 1
            while q:
                u = q.popleft()
                for w in S[u]:
                    if not visited[w]:
                        visited[w] = True
                        seen += 1
                        q.append(w)

            # Restore the edge
            S[a].add(b)
            S[b].add(a)

            # If all nodes not reached, edge was a bridge
            return (seen == v)

        bridges = []
        for a, b in edges:
            if not is_connected_after_removal(a, b):
                bridges.append([a, b])

        bridges.sort()
        return bridges
```

### Complexity

* **Time:** `O(E * (V + E))` (too slow for large graphs, but acceptable as a teaching/reference solution).
* **Space:** `O(V + E)`.

# 4) Interview Q&A (the ones you‚Äôre likely to get)

**Q1. What‚Äôs the difference between a bridge and an articulation point?**

* A **bridge** is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components.
* An **articulation point** is a **vertex** whose removal increases the number of connected components.

**Q2. Why does the condition `low[v] > disc[u]` imply `(u, v)` is a bridge?**
Because `low[v]` is the earliest ancestor time reachable from `v`‚Äôs subtree using back edges.
If `low[v] > disc[u]`, `v`‚Äôs subtree cannot reach `u` or any ancestor of `u` without using edge `(u, v)`.
Hence removing `(u, v)` disconnects the graph.

**Q3. Do back edges go both ways in undirected graphs?**
In undirected graphs, every edge is stored twice in the adjacency list.
In DFS, a **back edge** is an edge from a node to an **ancestor** in the DFS tree (identified by `disc[ancestor] < disc[curr]` and `ancestor != parent[curr]`).

**Q4. How do you handle disconnected graphs?**
Run DFS from each unvisited node (outer loop over all vertices).
Bridges are still found per component. (The problem statement says connected, but this makes the code robust.)

**Q5. Time/space complexity of Tarjan‚Äôs bridge algorithm?**

* Time: `O(V + E)`
* Space: `O(V)` (plus recursion stack)

**Q6. What if there are parallel edges between the same two vertices?**
Parallel edges mean removing one of them does not disconnect the endpoints, so none of the parallel edges is a bridge.
Tarjan‚Äôs algorithm still works, but make sure not to treat the parent edge as a back edge. (Most competitive setups avoid multi-edges.)

**Q7. Why must we return edges in sorted order (and how)?**
To match the judge‚Äôs expected format.
Sort each pair as `[min(u, v), max(u, v)]`, then sort the list of pairs lexicographically.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (high-impact)

* **Network reliability & maintenance**
  Detect single points of failure in communication networks (edges whose failure disconnects subnets). Prioritize redundancy there.

* **Power grids / transportation**
  Identify lines/roads that, if disrupted, isolate regions. Helps in resilience planning and targeted hardening.

* **Microservice architecture**
  In service dependency graphs, a bridge call path indicates a service/channel without alternative routes ‚Äî a risk for cascading failures.

* **Social & knowledge graphs**
  Bridges show relationships that connect distinct communities; useful for community detection and viral diffusion strategies.

* **Version control / build graphs**
  Identify critical dependencies between modules where lack of alternative paths suggests brittle build pipelines.
