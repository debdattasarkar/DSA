## üìò Problem Statement

Given a **Directed Graph**, find a **Mother Vertex** in the graph *(if present)*.

A **Mother Vertex** is a vertex through which we can reach **all other vertices** of the graph.

---

## üß† Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input:
```

![Graph Example 1](attachment\:image_1)

```
Output:
0
```

**Explanation:**
According to the given edges, all nodes can be reached from nodes 0, 1, and 2.
But, since **0** is minimum among 0, 1, and 2, **0** is the output.

---

### Example 2:

```
Input:
```

![Graph Example 2](attachment\:image_2)

```
Output:
-1
```

**Explanation:**
According to the given edges, there are **no vertices** from which we can reach all other vertices.
Hence, output is **-1**.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Your Task

You don‚Äôt need to read input or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function:

```python
def findMotherVertex(V, adj):
    # code here
```

which takes **V** (number of vertices) and **adj** (adjacency list) as input parameters and returns the vertex through which we can reach all other vertices of the graph.

If there is **more than one possible vertex**, return the one with **minimum value**.
If **no such vertex** exists, return **-1**.

Here‚Äôs a crisp interview-ready guide to the **Mother Vertex** problem with a worked dry run, two Python solutions (brute-force and optimal), and the common Q&A you‚Äôll face.

---

## 2) Concept & Step-by-Step Dry Run

### What is a ‚ÄúMother Vertex‚Äù?

In a **directed** graph, a vertex **m** is a *mother vertex* if from **m** you can reach **every** vertex.

### Key facts you can state in an interview

* In the **condensation DAG** of SCCs (strongly connected components), a mother vertex exists iff there is a **single source SCC** (indegree 0).
* **Every node in that source SCC is a mother vertex**. If multiple exist, return the **minimum index** among them.

### Classic optimal idea (1 DFS + verification; Kosaraju intuition)

1. Run DFS over all vertices to find the **last finished vertex** (`candidate`).
   Intuition: if a mother exists, one of them (any node in the source SCC) will finish last.
2. Verify by doing a DFS/BFS from `candidate`. If you can‚Äôt reach all nodes ‚Üí **no mother** (`-1`).
3. To return the **minimum mother** (if multiple), compute the **SCC of `candidate`** (e.g., via a single Kosaraju pass using the same finishing order) and return the **min index** in that SCC.

This keeps the full solution **O(V + E)**.

---

### Dry run (matches the picture in Example-1)

Edges sketch (one valid example consistent with the image):

```
0 ‚Üí 2, 0 ‚Üí 3
1 ‚Üí 0, 1 ‚Üí 2
2 ‚Üí 0
3 ‚Üí 4
```

* DFS finishing order might end with `0` (any node in the source SCC `{0,1,2}` can be last).
* Verify from `0`: can reach `{0,1,2,3,4}` ‚áí mother exists.
* Compute SCC containing `0` on the **transpose**: it‚Äôs `{0,1,2}`.
* **Minimum** in this SCC is `0` ‚áí answer `0`.

Example-2‚Äôs graph has **no** vertex that can reach all others, so we return `-1`.

---

## 3) Python solutions (brute & optimal)

### A) Brute force (simple but slower) ‚Äî O(V¬∑(V+E))

Try each vertex as a start; if its DFS reaches all, return it (the first found will also be the minimum because we test vertices in increasing order).

```python
class Solution:
    
    # Function to find a Mother Vertex in the Graph (Brute Force).
    # Time : O(V * (V + E))
    # Space: O(V) for visited
    def findMotherVertex(self, V, adj):
        def dfs(src, seen):
            stack = [src]
            seen[src] = True
            cnt = 1
            while stack:
                u = stack.pop()
                for v in adj[u]:
                    if not seen[v]:
                        seen[v] = True
                        cnt += 1
                        stack.append(v)
            return cnt
        
        # Try every vertex in increasing order ‚Üí the first that reaches all is the minimum index.
        for u in range(V):
            seen = [False] * V
            if dfs(u, seen) == V:
                return u
        return -1
```

---

### B) Optimal (single finishing-time DFS + verification + SCC min) ‚Äî O(V+E)

This returns the **minimum mother** when it exists, in linear time.

```python
class Solution:
    
    # Function to find a Mother Vertex in the Graph (Optimal: O(V + E)).
    # Steps:
    # 1) One DFS sweep to get a 'candidate' (last finished vertex).
    # 2) Verify candidate reaches all vertices.
    # 3) Return the minimum index inside candidate's SCC (Kosaraju 2nd pass from top of stack on transpose).
    def findMotherVertex(self, V, adj):
        # ----- 1) finishing-time DFS to get candidate -----
        visited = [False] * V
        order = []  # We‚Äôll push vertices after exploring all descendants (postorder)
        
        def dfs1(u):
            visited[u] = True
            for v in adj[u]:
                if not visited[v]:
                    dfs1(v)
            order.append(u)
        
        for u in range(V):
            if not visited[u]:
                dfs1(u)
        
        candidate = order[-1]  # last finished vertex
        
        # ----- 2) verify candidate reaches everyone -----
        def count_reach(start):
            seen = [False] * V
            stack = [start]
            seen[start] = True
            cnt = 1
            while stack:
                x = stack.pop()
                for y in adj[x]:
                    if not seen[y]:
                        seen[y] = True
                        cnt += 1
                        stack.append(y)
            return cnt
        
        if count_reach(candidate) != V:
            return -1  # No mother vertex exists
        
        # ----- 3) return MIN index among candidate's SCC -----
        # Build transpose graph (reverse edges): O(V + E)
        tr = [[] for _ in range(V)]
        for u in range(V):
            for v in adj[u]:
                tr[v].append(u)
        
        # Kosaraju: on transpose, a DFS from candidate (as top of stack) yields its SCC.
        comp = []
        seen2 = [False] * V
        stack = [candidate]
        seen2[candidate] = True
        while stack:
            u = stack.pop()
            comp.append(u)
            for w in tr[u]:
                if not seen2[w]:
                    seen2[w] = True
                    stack.append(w)
        
        # Any vertex inside the source SCC is a mother; we return the MIN index per problem.
        return min(comp)
```

**Why this returns the minimum:**
If a mother exists, the graph‚Äôs condensation has **one source SCC**. The last-finished node lies in that SCC. All its members are mothers; returning `min` over that component yields the required minimum.

---

## 4) Interview Q&A

**Q1. What is a Mother Vertex?**
A vertex from which **every** vertex in the directed graph is reachable.

**Q2. Prove correctness of the ‚Äúlast finished vertex‚Äù approach.**
Consider the **condensation DAG** of SCCs. If a mother exists, there is exactly **one source SCC**. Any DFS finishing order over the entire graph ensures a vertex from the source SCC finishes **last**. Verifying reachability from this candidate confirms existence.

**Q3. Why do we need the verification step?**
If the graph has **multiple source SCCs** or no mother, the last-finished vertex might not reach everyone. Verification detects this case.

**Q4. How to return the *minimum* mother when multiple exist?**
All mothers are exactly the vertices in the **single source SCC**. After verifying existence, compute the SCC containing the candidate (e.g., one Kosaraju pass on the transpose seeded with the candidate) and return the **minimum index** in that SCC.

**Q5. Time/Space complexity?**

* Brute force: **O(V¬∑(V+E))**.
* Optimal (finishing order + verification + one SCC on transpose): **O(V+E)** time, **O(V+E)** space.

**Q6. What if the graph is disconnected?**
The optimal algorithm still works. We run the first DFS from all undiscovered nodes to cover every component and build finishing order correctly.

**Q7. Can we use Kosaraju/Tarjan directly?**
Yes. Run SCC decomposition, build the condensation graph, check there‚Äôs a **single source component**; if so, return the **minimum vertex** in that component, else `-1`. This is also **O(V+E)**.

Below is a **complete, runnable Python program** for the **Mother Vertex** problem that:

* Implements the **optimal O(V+E)** solution (finishing-time DFS ‚Üí verify ‚Üí return minimum in the candidate‚Äôs SCC).
* Also includes a **brute-force O(V¬∑(V+E))** variant for comparison.
* Prints **inputs & outputs** for two sample graphs.
* Uses **timeit** to report the **average runtime**.
* Has **inline comments** calling out the **time & space complexity** of each step.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (just the essentials)

1. **Control/Orchestration Node in Directed Workflows**
   A mother vertex identifies a node from which **all tasks** (nodes) can be triggered/reached‚Äîuseful in designing **job pipelines** or **build systems**.

2. **Information/Update Propagation Source**
   In directed communication or dependency networks, a mother vertex is a **single source** that can disseminate updates to **every node**‚Äîhandy for **cache invalidation** or **feature flag rollout**.

3. **Root of a Condensed System (SCC DAG)**
   In software module graphs or service call graphs, a mother vertex indicates a **source SCC**; useful to understand **boot order**, **deployment sequence**, or **impact analysis**.
