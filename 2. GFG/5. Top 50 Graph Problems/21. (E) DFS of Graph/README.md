## **Problem Statement**

Given a **connected undirected graph** containing **V** vertices represented by a 2-D adjacency list `adj[][]`, where each `adj[i]` represents the list of vertices connected to vertex `i`, perform a **Depth First Search (DFS)** traversal starting from **vertex 0**, visiting vertices from **left to right as per the given adjacency list**, and return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.

> **Note:** Do traverse in the **same order** as they are in the given **adjacency list**.

---

## **Examples**

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```python
adj = [[2, 3, 1], [0], [0, 4], [0], [2]]
```

**Graph Structure:**

```
     0
   / | \
  2  3  1
  |
  4
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 2, 4, 3, 1]
```

**Explanation:**
Starting from 0, the DFS traversal proceeds as follows:

* Visit 0 ‚Üí Output: `[0]`
* Visit 2 (the first neighbor of 0) ‚Üí Output: `[0, 2]`
* Visit 4 (the first neighbor of 2) ‚Üí Output: `[0, 2, 4]`
* Backtrack to 2, then backtrack to 0, and visit 3 ‚Üí Output: `[0, 2, 4, 3]`
* Finally, backtrack to 0 and visit 1 ‚Üí Final Output: `[0, 2, 4, 3, 1]`

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```python
adj = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3, 4], [2], [2]]
```

**Graph Structure:**

```
     0
    / \
   1   2
      / \
     3   4
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Explanation:**
Starting from 0, the DFS traversal proceeds as follows:

* Visit 0 ‚Üí Output: `[0]`
* Visit 1 (the first neighbor of 0) ‚Üí Output: `[0, 1]`
* Visit 2 (the first neighbor of 1) ‚Üí Output: `[0, 1, 2]`
* Visit 3 (the first neighbor of 2) ‚Üí Output: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
* Backtrack to 2 and visit 4 ‚Üí Final Output: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

---

## **Constraints**

* $1 \leq V = \text{adj.size()} \leq 10^4$
* $1 \leq \text{adj}[i][j] \leq 10^4$

---

## **Expected Complexities**

* **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
* **Auxiliary Space:** O(V + E)

## ‚úÖ 2. **Text Explanation + Step-by-Step Dry Run**

### üîç Problem Summary:

You are given an **undirected**, **connected graph** represented as an **adjacency list**, and you need to return the **DFS traversal** starting from vertex `0`, visiting vertices **in the order provided** in the adjacency list.

---

### üå≥ DFS Traversal: Key Points

* Uses **recursion or stack**.
* Marks nodes as **visited** to avoid infinite loops.
* **Order matters** ‚Äì follow adjacency list as-is.
* Start from **vertex 0**.

---

### üß™ Example:

**Input:**

```python
adj = [[2, 3, 1], [0], [0, 4], [0], [2]]
```

### Step-by-step DFS traversal:

```
Start from 0 ‚Üí visited = {0}, result = [0]
- Neighbors of 0 = [2, 3, 1]
- Go to 2 ‚Üí visited = {0, 2}, result = [0, 2]
    - Neighbors of 2 = [0, 4]
    - 0 already visited ‚Üí Go to 4 ‚Üí visited = {0, 2, 4}, result = [0, 2, 4]
        - Neighbors of 4 = [2] ‚Üí already visited ‚Üí return
- Backtrack to 0 ‚Üí Next is 3 ‚Üí visited = {0, 2, 4, 3}, result = [0, 2, 4, 3]
    - Neighbors of 3 = [0] ‚Üí already visited ‚Üí return
- Backtrack to 0 ‚Üí Next is 1 ‚Üí visited = {0, 2, 4, 3, 1}, result = [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]
    - Neighbors of 1 = [0] ‚Üí already visited
```

### ‚úÖ Final Output:

```
[0, 2, 4, 3, 1]
```

## ‚úÖ 3. Python Code ‚Äì Brute and Optimized (with Inline Comments)

### üîπ **Optimized DFS using Recursion (Most Common in Interviews)**

```python
class Solution:

    # Function to return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.
    def dfs(self, adj):
        V = len(adj)
        visited = [False] * V       # Track visited nodes
        result = []

        def dfs_util(v):
            visited[v] = True
            result.append(v)
            for neighbor in adj[v]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    dfs_util(neighbor)

        dfs_util(0)  # Start DFS from node 0
        return result
```

---

### üîπ **DFS using Iterative Approach (using Stack)**

```python
class Solution:

    # Iterative DFS using explicit stack
    def dfs(self, adj):
        V = len(adj)
        visited = [False] * V
        result = []

        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            if not visited[node]:
                visited[node] = True
                result.append(node)
                # Add neighbors in reverse order to preserve original order when popped
                for neighbor in reversed(adj[node]):
                    if not visited[neighbor]:
                        stack.append(neighbor)
        return result
```

---

### üîπ **Brute Force (For Understanding ‚Äì Not recommended in interviews)**

```python
class Solution:

    def dfs(self, adj):
        V = len(adj)
        result = []
        visited = set()

        def recurse(node):
            if node in visited:
                return
            visited.add(node)
            result.append(node)
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                recurse(neighbor)

        recurse(0)
        return result
```

## ‚úÖ 4. **Expected Interview Questions & Answers**

### ‚ùì Q1: What is DFS?

**‚úÖ A:** DFS (Depth First Search) is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from a source node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

---

### ‚ùì Q2: What‚Äôs the time and space complexity of DFS?

* **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(V)` for visited + call stack (or explicit stack)

---

### ‚ùì Q3: How is DFS different from BFS?

| DFS                                | BFS                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Uses Stack (recursion or explicit) | Uses Queue                                  |
| Explores depth-wise                | Explores level-wise                         |
| May not find the shortest path     | Finds the shortest path (unweighted graphs) |

---

### ‚ùì Q4: How do you avoid revisiting nodes in DFS?

**‚úÖ A:** By maintaining a `visited[]` array or `set` to mark nodes already visited.

---

### ‚ùì Q5: Is DFS recursive or iterative?

**‚úÖ A:** DFS is naturally recursive but can be implemented iteratively using a stack.

---

### ‚ùì Q6: What kind of graphs work with this DFS function?

* Connected
* Undirected
* Adjacency list representation
* No self-loops or parallel edges assumed unless mentioned

---

### ‚ùì Q7: Why do we traverse in the same order as adjacency list?

**‚úÖ A:** Because the problem explicitly says so. It affects the DFS output. This is important for deterministic DFS output.
