## 🧾 Problem Statement

Given an **undirected, weighted graph** with `V` vertices numbered from `0` to `V - 1` and `E` edges, represented by 2D array `edges[][]`, where:

* Each entry `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` denotes an **edge** between nodes `u` and `v` with **edge weight** `w`.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

You have to **find the shortest distance** of all the vertices from the **source vertex** `src`, and return an **array of integers** where the `i-th` element denotes the \*\*shortest distance between vertex `i` and source vertex `src`.

---

📌 **Note:**
The graph is **connected** and **doesn't contain any negative weight edges**.

---

## 💡 Examples

---

### 🧪 Example 1:

**Input:**

```
V = 3
edges = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 6]]
src = 2
```

**Graph:**

```
    0
   / \
  1---2 (source)
```

**Output:**

```
[4, 3, 0]
```

**Explanation:**

Shortest Paths:

* From `2 → 0`: distance = 4 via `2 → 1 → 0`
* From `2 → 1`: distance = 3 via `2 → 1`
* From `2 → 2`: distance = 0

---

### 🧪 Example 2:

**Input:**

```
V = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 8], [1, 4, 6], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 10]]
src = 0
```

**Graph:**

```
0 → 1 → 4
 \       ↑
  → 2 → 3
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 4, 8, 10, 10]
```

**Explanation:**

Shortest Paths from 0:

* To 1: `0 → 1` = 4
* To 2: `0 → 2` = 8
* To 3: `0 → 2 → 3` = 10
* To 4: `0 → 1 → 4` = 10

---

## 📌 Constraints

```
1 ≤ V ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ E = edges.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ edges[i][j] ≤ 10^4
0 ≤ src < V
```

## ⏱ Expected Complexities

| Type             | Value               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | O((V + E) \* log V) |
| Space Complexity | O(V)                |

Let’s now dive deep into the **Dijkstra Algorithm** problem from your image.

## ✅ 2. Explanation with Step-by-Step Dry Run

---

### 🔍 **Goal**

Given a **connected undirected weighted graph** with **positive edge weights**, return the **shortest distances** from a **source vertex** `src` to **all other vertices**.

---

### 🔑 Key Points

* Use a **greedy approach** to always process the node with the **smallest tentative distance**.
* Maintain a **min-heap (priority queue)** to extract the minimum distance vertex efficiently.
* Use a **distance array** to store minimum known distances from the source.

---

### 🧪 Example

**Input:**

```python
V = 3
edges = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 6]]
src = 2
```

**Adjacency List (Undirected):**

```
0: (1, 1), (2, 6)
1: (0, 1), (2, 3)
2: (1, 3), (0, 6)
```

### 🔄 Dry Run from `src = 2`:

Initialize:

```python
dist = [inf, inf, 0]  # Distance to self is 0
minHeap = [(0, 2)]    # (distance, node)
```

#### Iteration 1:

Pop `(0, 2)` → Explore neighbors of 2:

* `(1, 3)` → `dist[1] = min(inf, 0 + 3) = 3`
* `(0, 6)` → `dist[0] = min(inf, 0 + 6) = 6`

```python
minHeap = [(3, 1), (6, 0)]
dist = [6, 3, 0]
```

#### Iteration 2:

Pop `(3, 1)` → Explore neighbors of 1:

* `(0, 1)` → `dist[0] = min(6, 3 + 1) = 4` ✅ better path

```python
minHeap = [(4, 0), (6, 0)]
dist = [4, 3, 0]
```

#### Iteration 3:

Pop `(4, 0)` → Explore neighbors of 0:

* Neighbors already have better distances → skip

```python
minHeap = [(6, 0)]
```

#### Iteration 4:

Pop `(6, 0)` → already visited → skip

✅ Final `dist = [4, 3, 0]`

### 🔹 Efficient Dijkstra Using Min-Heap (heapq)

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    # Returns shortest distances from src to all other vertices
    def dijkstra(self, V, edges, src):
        # Build adjacency list: O(E)
        adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]
        for u, v, w in edges:
            adj[u].append((v, w))
            adj[v].append((u, w))  # Since the graph is undirected

        # Distance array initialized to infinity
        dist = [float('inf')] * V
        dist[src] = 0

        # Min-heap to get the minimum distance vertex fast
        minHeap = [(0, src)]  # (distance, node)

        while minHeap:
            curr_dist, u = heapq.heappop(minHeap)

            # Traverse all adjacent vertices
            for v, weight in adj[u]:
                if dist[v] > curr_dist + weight:
                    dist[v] = curr_dist + weight
                    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (dist[v], v))

        return dist
```

---

### 🔹 Time and Space Complexity

| Step                 | Time Complexity      | Space Complexity |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Build adjacency list | O(E)                 | O(V + E)         |
| Min-Heap operations  | O((V + E) \* log V)  | O(V)             |
| Total                | **O((V + E) log V)** | **O(V + E)**     |

---

### 🔸 Brute Force (For learning purpose only)

* Use `dist[]` and linearly search for the smallest unvisited node in each iteration.
* Time: **O(V²)** → not efficient for large graphs.

---

## ✅ 4. Interview Q\&A

---

### ❓ Q1: Why can't Dijkstra's algorithm handle negative weights?

**✅ A:**
Dijkstra assumes that once a node is visited with the smallest distance, it doesn't need to be updated.
**Negative weights** can break this assumption and lead to incorrect paths.
Use **Bellman-Ford** for graphs with negative weights.

---

### ❓ Q2: What data structure makes Dijkstra efficient?

**✅ A:**
**Min-Heap (priority queue)** using `heapq` in Python makes Dijkstra efficient, improving time to **O((V + E) log V)**.

---

### ❓ Q3: What if the graph is **directed**?

**✅ A:**
Simply remove the line that adds `adj[v].append((u, w))` and treat the edge as one-way.

---

### ❓ Q4: Can Dijkstra detect negative cycles?

**❌ A:**
No. Dijkstra does not work with negative edges and **cannot detect cycles**. Use **Bellman-Ford** instead.

---

### ❓ Q5: What are some real-world use cases of Dijkstra’s Algorithm?

**✅ A:**

* GPS navigation & route planning (shortest road)
* Network routing protocols (e.g., OSPF)
* Robotics pathfinding
* Traffic engineering
* Airline flight booking systems (shortest connections)
