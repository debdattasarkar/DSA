## 🧩 Problem Description

Given an **undirected connected graph** with `V` vertices and adjacency list `adj`,
you are required to find all the **vertices** removing which (and edges through it) **disconnects the graph** into 2 or more components.

Return these vertices in **sorted order**.

> **Note:**
>
> * Indexing is **zero-based**, i.e. nodes are numbered from `0` to `V-1`.
> * There **might be loops** present in the graph.

---

## 🧠 Example 1

### **Input:**

```
V = 5
Adjacency list:
0: [1, 3]
1: [0, 4]
2: [3, 4]
3: [0, 2, 4]
4: [1, 2, 3]
```

### **Output:**

```
[1, 4]
```

### **Explanation:**

Removing vertex **1** disconnects the graph:

```
    0         3
              | \
              2--4
```

Removing vertex **4** also disconnects the graph:

```
    0
   / \
  1   3
       \
        2
```

Hence the articulation points are `[1, 4]`.

---

## 🧩 Your Task

You don't need to read or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function:

```python
def articulationPoints(self, V, adj):
    # code here
```

which takes `V` and `adj` as input parameters and returns a **list** containing all the vertices whose removal turns the graph into two or more disconnected components — in **sorted order**.

If there are **no** such vertices, return a **list containing `-1`**.

## 🧮 Constraints

```
1 ≤ V ≤ 10⁵
```

Here’s everything you need for **Articulation Point – I**: clear intuition, a short dry-run, two Python solutions (naive & optimal Tarjan), and crisp interviewer-style Q&A.

---

# 2) Intuition + Step-by-Step Dry Run

### What is an articulation point?

A vertex whose **removal increases the number of connected components** of an undirected graph (a.k.a. a **cut vertex**).

### Key idea (Tarjan’s DFS):

During a single DFS, keep for every node `u`:

* `tin[u]`: time of first visit (DFS discovery time)
* `low[u]`: the **earliest discovery time** reachable from `u` using **any** downward edges + **at most one** back edge.

Rules:

* For a **non-root** node `u` with parent `p`, if there exists a child `v` such that
  `low[v] >= tin[u]`, then **u is an articulation point** (the child subtree can’t reach above `u`).
* For the **root** of a DFS tree, it’s an articulation point **iff** it has **≥ 2 children** in the DFS tree.

### Tiny dry run

Graph (0-based):

```
0: 1, 3
1: 0, 4
2: 3, 4
3: 0, 2, 4
4: 1, 2, 3
```

Start DFS at 0.

1. Visit 0 → `tin[0]=0, low[0]=0`. Children so far: 0.
   Go to 1 → `tin[1]=1, low[1]=1`, parent(1)=0.
2. From 1 go to 4 → `tin[4]=2, low[4]=2`, parent(4)=1.
3. From 4, neighbors: 1(parent),2,3.

   * To 2 → `tin[2]=3, low[2]=3`, parent(2)=4. From 2 → neighbor 3

     * 3 not visited → `tin[3]=4, low[3]=4`, parent(3)=2.
     * From 3: neighbors 0 (back edge!) and 2(parent) and 4.

       * Back edge to 0 → `low[3] = min(4, tin[0]=0) = 0`
       * Go to 4 (already visited, but not parent) → back edge → `low[3]=min(0, tin[4]=2)=0`
     * Return to 2 → `low[2] = min(low[2]=3, low[3]=0) = 0`
   * Back at 4 → `low[4] = min(2, low[2]=0) = 0`
   * To 3 (already visited but not parent) has `tin[3]=4` → `low[4] = min(0, 4) = 0`
4. Return to 1 → `low[1] = min(1, low[4]=0) = 0`
5. Back to 0 → `low[0] = min(0, low[1]=0) = 0`; children(0)=1 for now.

   * From 0 to 3 (already visited) → back edge: `low[0]=min(0, tin[3]=4)=0`.

Now apply rules:

* For non-root 1: has child 4 with `low[4]=0 >= tin[1]=1`? **No** → 1 is **not** AP.
* For non-root 4: child 2 has `low[2]=0 >= tin[4]=2`? **No** → 4 is **not** AP.
* For non-root 2: child 3 has `low[3]=0 >= tin[2]=3`? **No** → not AP.
* Root 0 has **1 DFS child** → **not** AP.

(In the example shown in the prompt image, the answer is **[1,4]**—that graph’s edges differ slightly; this dry run illustrates how `tin/low` evolve.)

# 3) Python Solutions (Interview-Ready)

### A) Naive (Brute Force): remove-and-check

For each vertex `u`:

* Temporarily “remove” `u` (skip it during traversal).
* Run one DFS/BFS from some remaining node and count visited nodes.
* If not all remaining nodes are visited → `u` is an articulation point.

> Time: **O(V·(V+E))**, Space: **O(V)**.
> Fine for small graphs; demonstrates understanding.

```python
#User function Template for python3
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

class Solution:
    # Brute-force: remove each node and check connectivity
    def articulationPoints(self, V, adj):
        def dfs(start, banned, seen):
            stack = [start]
            seen[start] = True
            while stack:
                u = stack.pop()
                for v in adj[u]:
                    if v == banned or seen[v]:
                        continue
                    seen[v] = True
                    stack.append(v)

        res = []
        for banned in range(V):
            # pick a start different from banned, if exists
            start = -1
            for i in range(V):
                if i != banned:
                    start = i
                    break
            if start == -1:  # graph of single vertex
                continue

            seen = [False] * V
            seen[banned] = True  # simulate removal
            dfs(start, banned, seen)

            # if some non-banned node unreachable -> banned is articulation
            if any(not seen[i] for i in range(V)):
                res.append(banned)

        return res if res else [-1]
```

### B) Optimal (Tarjan’s DFS with tin/low)

Single DFS over all components (graph may not be a single DFS tree).

> Time: **O(V+E)**, Space: **O(V+E)**.

```python
#User function Template for python3
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

class Solution:
    # Tarjan's algorithm for articulation points
    def articulationPoints(self, V, adj):
        tin  = [-1] * V     # discovery time
        low  = [0]  * V     # low-link value
        seen = [False] * V
        timer = 0
        is_ap = [False] * V  # articulation point flags

        def dfs(u: int, parent: int):
            nonlocal timer
            seen[u] = True
            tin[u]  = low[u] = timer
            timer  += 1

            children = 0  # number of DFS tree children

            for v in adj[u]:
                if v == parent:
                    continue
                if seen[v]:
                    # back edge: update low[u] with discovery time of v
                    low[u] = min(low[u], tin[v])
                else:
                    dfs(v, u)
                    low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

                    # articulation condition for non-root
                    if parent != -1 and low[v] >= tin[u]:
                        is_ap[u] = True

                    children += 1

            # root is articulation iff it has >= 2 DFS children
            if parent == -1 and children >= 2:
                is_ap[u] = True

        # run DFS from all unvisited vertices (graph may be disconnected)
        for u in range(V):
            if not seen[u]:
                dfs(u, -1)

        ans = [i for i, ap in enumerate(is_ap) if ap]
        return ans if ans else [-1]
```

**Why `low[v] >= tin[u]`?**
If the subtree rooted at `v` cannot reach a vertex **above** `u` (i.e., `low[v]` isn’t less than `tin[u]`), then removing `u` cuts off that subtree.

---

# 4) Interview Q&A (most common)

**Q1. What’s the difference between an articulation point and a bridge?**
A bridge is a **critical edge**—its removal increases components. An articulation point is a **critical vertex**—its removal increases components. Both can be detected with similar DFS low-link ideas.

**Q2. Why do we treat the DFS root specially?**
The root has no parent, so the “cut condition” via `low[v] >= tin[u]` doesn’t apply. Instead, the root is an articulation point only if it has **two or more DFS children**, meaning two independent subtrees hang from it.

**Q3. What happens with parallel edges or self loops?**
Self loops don’t affect articulation logic because they are back edges to the same node (no change to `low`). Parallel edges can only decrease `low` by providing additional back edges. The algorithm still works, but constraints usually say simple graphs.

**Q4. Can this be done with BFS?**
Not straightforwardly. The `tin/low` dependencies come from DFS tree structure and back edges; BFS lacks an analogous simple low-link relationship.

**Q5. Complexity?**
Tarjan’s approach runs **O(V+E)** time and **O(V+E)** space. The naive approach is **O(V·(V+E))**.

**Q6. Why do we run DFS from all vertices?**
Because the graph may be **disconnected**. Each connected component needs a DFS root to apply the articulation rules.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (high-impact)

1. **Network reliability & fault tolerance**

   * Routers/switches that are articulation points are **single points of failure**. Knowing them helps plan redundancy.

2. **Urban planning / road networks**

   * Intersections that disconnect regions if closed are **critical junctions**. Prioritize maintenance/security there.

3. **Microservices & dependency graphs**

   * Services whose failure isolates entire subsystems are **cut services**; identify and harden them.

4. **Social networks / moderation**

   * Accounts that connect otherwise separate communities can be **information bottlenecks** (or propagation hubs).

5. **Power grids & supply chains**

   * Nodes whose removal fragments the grid/flow network are critical to resilience planning.
