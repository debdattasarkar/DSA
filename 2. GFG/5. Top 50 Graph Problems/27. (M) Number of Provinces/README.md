## Problem Statement

Given an **undirected** graph with **V** vertices, we say two vertices **u** and **v** belong to a single province if there is a path from **u to v** or **v to u**. Your task is to find the number of **provinces**.

> **Note:** A **province** is a group of **directly or indirectly connected** cities and no other cities outside of the group.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```python
[[1, 0, 1],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1]]
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation:**
The graph clearly has **2 Provinces**: \[1, 3] and \[2]. As city 1 and city 3 have a path between them, they belong to a single province. City 2 has no path to city 1 or 3 hence it belongs to another province.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```python
[[1, 1],
 [1, 1]]
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

---

## Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function:

```python
def numProvinces(V: int, adj: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```

which takes an integer `V` and an adjacency matrix `adj` (as a 2D vector) as input and returns the number of provinces.

> `adj[i][j] = 1` if nodes i and j are connected and `adj[i][j] = 0` if not connected.

## Expected Time and Space Complexity

* **Auxiliary Space:** O(V)

## ‚úÖ 2. Text Explanation with Step-by-Step Dry Run

### üîç Problem Summary:

* You are given a `V x V` adjacency matrix.
* `adj[i][j] == 1` means city `i` and city `j` are directly connected.
* You must count the number of **connected components** (called **provinces** here).

---

### üß† Approach: DFS (Depth-First Search)

* Treat each row/column as a node.
* Whenever you visit a node **not visited yet**, start a **DFS from there**, and mark all reachable nodes.
* Every new DFS = one new province.

---

### üß™ Dry Run Example

Input:

```python
V = 3
adj = [[1, 0, 1],
       [0, 1, 0],
       [1, 0, 1]]
```

Graph View:

* Node 0 is connected to Node 2
* Node 2 is connected to Node 0
* Node 1 is isolated (no connections except self)

DFS Calls:

* Start from node 0 ‚Üí Visit 0 ‚Üí Visit 2 ‚Üí Done ‚Üí Province count = 1
* Node 1 is not visited ‚Üí Start DFS ‚Üí Province count = 2
* Node 2 is already visited.

‚úÖ **Output: 2**

## ‚úÖ 3. Python Code ‚Äî DFS (Most Common in Interviews)

### ‚úÖ Optimized DFS Version (Expected in Interviews)

```python
# User function Template for python3

class Solution:
    def numProvinces(self, adj, V):
        def dfs(node, visited):
            visited[node] = True
            for neighbor in range(V):
                # Check if connected and not visited
                if adj[node][neighbor] == 1 and not visited[neighbor]:
                    dfs(neighbor, visited)

        visited = [False] * V
        count = 0

        # Run DFS for every unvisited node
        for i in range(V):
            if not visited[i]:
                count += 1
                dfs(i, visited)
        
        return count
```

### ‚è± Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(V¬≤)
  ‚Üí Because we loop through entire adjacency matrix.
* **Space Complexity:** O(V)
  ‚Üí For the `visited` array and recursion stack.

---

## ‚úÖ Alternative: BFS Version (Also Acceptable)

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def numProvinces(self, adj, V):
        def bfs(start, visited):
            q = deque()
            q.append(start)
            visited[start] = True

            while q:
                node = q.popleft()
                for neighbor in range(V):
                    if adj[node][neighbor] == 1 and not visited[neighbor]:
                        visited[neighbor] = True
                        q.append(neighbor)

        visited = [False] * V
        count = 0

        for i in range(V):
            if not visited[i]:
                count += 1
                bfs(i, visited)

        return count
```

## ‚úÖ 4. Interviewer Questions and Expected Answers

---

### ‚ùìQ1. What does this problem reduce to in graph terms?

**A:** It reduces to **counting the number of connected components** in an undirected graph represented by an adjacency matrix.

---

### ‚ùìQ2. Why use DFS or BFS here?

**A:** Both help traverse all nodes in one connected component efficiently. Each unvisited node that triggers DFS/BFS indicates a **new province**.

---

### ‚ùìQ3. What if the graph was sparse?

**A:** Then using an **adjacency list** would be better for space and time efficiency. But since input is a matrix, we use matrix traversal.

---

### ‚ùìQ4. Can we use Union-Find (DSU) here?

**A:** Yes! Union-Find is another optimal method for counting components.

---

### ‚ùìQ5. How would this change for a **directed** graph?

**A:** We'd need to count **strongly connected components** (SCC) using Kosaraju‚Äôs or Tarjan‚Äôs algorithm ‚Äî not applicable here since graph is undirected.
