## üß© Problem Description

Given a **Directed Graph** having `V` vertices and `E` edges,
Find the members of **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)** in the graph.

> **Note:** Sort both the **individual components** and the **array of components**.

---

## üß† Example 1

### **Input:**

```
V = 5
Edges:
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 0
0 -> 3
3 -> 4
```

### **Output:**

```
0 1 2 3 4
```

### **Explanation:**

The graph can be visualized as:

```
  0 ‚Üí 1
  ‚Üë   ‚Üì
  2 ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îò
   ‚Üì
   3 ‚Üí 4
```

We can clearly see that there are **3 Strongly Connected Components** in the graph:

1. `{0, 1, 2}`
2. `{3}`
3. `{4}`

When combined in lexicographical order:

```
0 1 2 3 4
```

---

## üß† Example 2

### **Input:**

```
V = 3
Edges:
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 0
```

### **Output:**

```
0 1 2
```

### **Explanation:**

All of the nodes are reachable from each other (mutual connectivity).
So there is **only one Strongly Connected Component (SCC)** in the graph.

---

## üß© Your Task

You don‚Äôt need to read or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function:

```python
def tarjans(self, V, adj):
    # code here
```

which takes:

* the number of vertices `V`, and
* adjacency list of the graph `adj`
  as input parameters and returns a **list of lists** of integers denoting the members of all SCCs in the graph.

---

### üîé Important Notes

* Each individual **Strongly Connected Component (SCC)** must be represented as a **list of integers sorted in ascending order**.
* The resulting **list of SCCs** must be sorted such that the **lexicographically smaller list appears first**.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
* **Auxiliary Space:** O(V)

---

## üîí Constraints

```
1 ‚â§ V ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
1 ‚â§ E ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
0 ‚â§ u, v < N
```

Here‚Äôs a compact interview-ready cheat-sheet for **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)** with a clear dry-run and two Python solutions (Tarjan‚Äôs one-pass and Kosaraju‚Äôs two-pass).

---

# 2) Concept + Step-by-Step Dry Run

## Problem recap

Given a directed graph `adj` of `V` vertices (`0..V-1`), return **all SCCs** (each SCC sorted ascending), and the list of SCCs sorted **lexicographically**.

### What is an SCC?

A maximal set of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the set.

---

## Tarjan‚Äôs algorithm (intuition)

We perform a single DFS and maintain:

* `disc[u]`: discovery time of `u` (first DFS time we see it).
* `low[u]`: the **lowest discovery time** reachable from `u` via **any** path that uses 0+ tree edges and **at most one** back edge.
* `in_stack[u]`: is `u` currently in the active recursion stack?
* A stack `st` of active nodes.

When we finish exploring `u`, if `low[u] == disc[u]`, then `u` is the **root** of an SCC. We pop nodes from the stack until we pop `u` ‚Üí that set is one SCC.

**Why it works:**
`low[u]` captures if we can reach an **earlier** ancestor (back edge). If we cannot (i.e., `low[u] == disc[u]`), the subgraph rooted at `u` cannot reach higher ancestors; hence it closes an SCC.

---

## Dry run on the classic example

Graph:

```
0 -> 1, 0 -> 3
1 -> 2
2 -> 0
3 -> 4
4 -> (none)
```

Adj list (0..4):

```
0: [1,3]
1: [2]
2: [0]
3: [4]
4: []
```

Start Tarjan from 0:

1. Visit 0:
   `disc[0]=0, low[0]=0`, push `0` (in stack)

   * Go 0‚Üí1
     Visit 1: `disc[1]=1, low[1]=1`, push `1`

     * Go 1‚Üí2
       Visit 2: `disc[2]=2, low[2]=2`, push `2`

       * Go 2‚Üí0 (0 is **in stack**) ‚Üí **back edge**
         `low[2] = min(low[2], disc[0]) = min(2,0) = 0`
         Return to 1: `low[1] = min(low[1], low[2]) = min(1,0)=0`
         Return to 0: `low[0] = min(low[0], low[1]) = min(0,0)=0`

   * Go 0‚Üí3
     Visit 3: `disc[3]=3, low[3]=3`, push `3`

     * Go 3‚Üí4
       Visit 4: `disc[4]=4, low[4]=4`, push `4`
       4 has no edges ‚Üí `low[4]==disc[4]` ‚áí pop SCC `{4}`
       Back to 3: `low[3] = min(3, low[4]=4) = 3`
       `low[3]==disc[3]` ‚áí pop SCC `{3}`

Finish 0: Check `low[0]==disc[0]` ‚áí yes (0 is root).
Pop until 0: pop `2,1,0` ‚Üí SCC `{0,1,2}`

SCCs found: `{4}`, `{3}`, `{0,1,2}`
Sort each SCC: `[ [4], [3], [0,1,2] ]`
Lexicographically sort list of SCCs: `[[0,1,2], [3], [4]]`

# 3) Optimized Codes (Tarjan + Kosaraju)

## A) Optimized one-pass Tarjan (typical interview favorite)

```python
# User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    # Return a list of lists of integers denoting SCC members.
    # Each SCC sorted; list of SCCs sorted lexicographically.
    def tarjans(self, V, adj):
        disc = [-1] * V         # discovery times
        low  = [0]  * V         # low-link values
        in_stack = [False] * V  # membership in current stack
        st = []                 # active nodes stack
        time = 0
        sccs = []

        def dfs(u):
            nonlocal time
            disc[u] = low[u] = time
            time += 1
            st.append(u); in_stack[u] = True

            for v in adj[u]:
                if disc[v] == -1:
                    # Tree edge
                    dfs(v)
                    low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])
                elif in_stack[v]:
                    # Back edge to an ancestor in the stack
                    low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

            # If u is the root of an SCC
            if low[u] == disc[u]:
                comp = []
                while True:
                    w = st.pop()
                    in_stack[w] = False
                    comp.append(w)
                    if w == u:
                        break
                comp.sort()     # sort the individual SCC
                sccs.append(comp)

        for u in range(V):
            if disc[u] == -1:
                dfs(u)

        # Sort the list of SCCs lexicographically
        sccs.sort()
        return sccs
```

**Complexity:**

* Time: **O(V + E)** (each edge and vertex processed O(1) amortized).
* Space: **O(V)** for recursion, arrays, stack.

**Why this is ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù:** One DFS traversal, no reverse graph or second pass.

---

## B) ‚ÄúBrute / Easy to reason‚Äù alternative: Kosaraju‚Äôs 2-pass (also O(V+E))

Idea:

1. DFS to compute **finishing order** (push nodes on a stack when exiting).
2. Reverse all edges.
3. Pop nodes from stack; for each unvisited node, DFS on **reversed** graph ‚Üí one SCC.

```python
class SolutionKosaraju:
    def tarjans(self, V, adj):
        # Implementing Kosaraju to match the required signature
        # (name kept as tarjans for the judge harness)
        g = adj
        order = []
        vis = [False] * V

        def dfs1(u):
            vis[u] = True
            for v in g[u]:
                if not vis[v]:
                    dfs1(v)
            order.append(u)  # finish time stack

        for u in range(V):
            if not vis[u]:
                dfs1(u)

        # Build reverse graph
        rg = [[] for _ in range(V)]
        for u in range(V):
            for v in g[u]:
                rg[v].append(u)

        # Second pass on reversed graph
        vis = [False] * V
        sccs = []

        def dfs2(u, comp):
            vis[u] = True
            comp.append(u)
            for v in rg[u]:
                if not vis[v]:
                    dfs2(v, comp)

        # Process in reverse finishing order
        for u in reversed(order):
            if not vis[u]:
                comp = []
                dfs2(u, comp)
                comp.sort()
                sccs.append(comp)

        sccs.sort()
        return sccs
```

**Complexity:**

* Time: **O(V + E)** (two DFS passes + reverse edges).
* Space: **O(V + E)** (extra reverse graph).

**When interviewers like this:** It‚Äôs conceptually simple and shows comfort with graph transformations and DFS order.

---

# 4) Common Interview Q&A

**Q1. What‚Äôs the difference between Tarjan‚Äôs and Kosaraju‚Äôs?**

* **Tarjan:** Single DFS pass using `disc/low`, a stack, detects SCC roots when `low[u]==disc[u]`.
* **Kosaraju:** Two DFS passes and a reversed graph.
  Both are **O(V+E)**; Tarjan is often slightly more memory-friendly and elegant in one pass.

**Q2. What does `low[u]` mean exactly?**
Minimum discovery time reachable from `u` using any number of tree edges and **at most one back edge** (to a node currently on stack in Tarjan).

**Q3. Why do we need the stack in Tarjan?**
To maintain the **current DFS component**. If we find a root (`low[u]==disc[u]`), we pop the stack to form that SCC.

**Q4. How do you ensure the required output order?**

* Sort each SCC‚Äôs node list after extraction.
* Sort the list of SCC lists lexicographically at the end.

**Q5. Edge cases to consider?**

* Disconnected graphs (run DFS from every unvisited node).
* Single node with/without self loop (self loop ‚Üí SCC of size 1 anyway).
* Acyclic graph (every node is an SCC of size 1).

**Q6. Recursion limits?**
In Python, deep graphs can cause recursion depth issues; either raise the recursion limit or convert to iterative DFS (allowed if interviewer asks).

**Q7. Can this be done iteratively?**
Yes, Tarjan can be implemented iteratively with an explicit stack and states, though code becomes more verbose. For interviews, recursive is fine.

---

### Quick sanity check with the dry-run graph

Input:

```
V = 5
adj = [[1,3],[2],[0],[4],[]]
```

Tarjan returns:

```
[[0,1,2],[3],[4]]
```

‚Ä¶which matches the expected lexicographic order.

Here‚Äôs a **ready-to-run program** that:

* implements **Tarjan‚Äôs one-pass SCC** (default) and a **Kosaraju two-pass** variant,
* documents **time & space complexity** right beside each step,
* runs a couple of **sample inputs** and prints the **outputs**, and
* measures total runtime using `timeit.default_timer()` (high-res clock).

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few high-impact ones)

1. **Microservice dependency analysis**
   Detect mutually dependent microservices (SCCs). Refactor or isolate cycles to improve deployability and fault isolation.

2. **Package/module managers**
   Identify cyclical dependencies between libraries or modules for safe build ordering and version conflict resolution.

3. **Program analysis & compilers**
   SCCs in call graphs / control-flow graphs enable optimizations like common subexpression elimination, inlining within strongly connected regions, or partial evaluation.

4. **Social/communication networks**
   Find tightly knit communities where every member can reach every other (e.g., mutual follow/DM reachability).

5. **Deadlock detection**
   In resource-allocation graphs, SCCs containing cycles can reveal potential or actual deadlocks.
