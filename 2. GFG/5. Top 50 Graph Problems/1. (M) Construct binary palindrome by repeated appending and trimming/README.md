## Problem Statement

You are given two integers **n** and **k**. Your task is to create a palindrome of length **n** using binary numbers (0s and 1s) of length **k** that starts with **1**. You can repeat the binary number as many times as you need, and you are allowed to remove any zeros from the end of the final palindrome.

The palindrome must always start with **1** and should have as many zeros as possible. If it is not possible to create such a palindrome of length **n** using any binary number of length **k**, return **-1**.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `n = 5, k = 3`
**Output:** `11011`
**Explanation:**
Since only length of 3 binary digits are allowed, the possible binary representations are `100, 110, 111, 101`. Out of these, If we take the binary representation of `6 (110)`, combine it twice & trim a zero the final output will be `11011`, which satisfy all the conditions.

---

### Example 2

**Input:** `n = 6, k = 1`
**Output:** `111111`
**Explanation:**
The binary representation of `1` is `1` of length `1`, it is combined six times to produce `111111`.

# 2) Clear explanation + step-by-step dry run

## Key idea

We must build a **palindrome** `S` of length `n` by **repeating** some binary block `B` of length `k` that **starts with 1** (i.e., `B[0] = '1'`). You may trim **trailing zeros** at the very end, but that’s equivalent to just taking the first `n` characters of the infinite repetition of `B`.
Therefore, the final string `S` is **k-periodic**:

```
S[i] = B[i % k]    for i = 0..n-1
```

Because `S` is also a palindrome, we need:

```
S[i] = S[n-1-i]  ⇒  B[i % k] = B[(n-1-i) % k]    for all i
```

Let

```
f(a) = (n - 1 - a) % k
```

Then every residue class `a ∈ [0..k-1]` must satisfy:

```
B[a] = B[f(a)]
```

The mapping `f` is an involution (applying twice gets back to `a`), so residues are partitioned into **pairs** `{a, f(a)}` (or a singleton if `a = f(a)`).

We want **as many zeros as possible** in `S`. The only hard constraint is `B[0] = '1'` (block starts with 1). Because `0` is paired with `p = f(0) = (n-1) % k`, the pair `{0, p}` must both be `'1'`. All **other pairs** can safely be set to `'0'` to maximize zeros.

That yields a super simple construction:

> For every index `i` in `0..n-1`, set
> `S[i] = '1'` **iff** `i % k` equals `0` **or** `(n-1) % k`; otherwise `S[i] = '0'`.

This `S` is guaranteed to be a palindrome, k-periodic, starts with `1`, and has the **maximum possible zeros**.

### Why trimming is mentioned

If you imagine forming a long repetition of `B`, our `S` is just the first `n` characters (if the next character(s) happened to be `0`, trimming those zeros is allowed; if not, no trimming needed). The rule never hurts us.

---

## Dry runs

### Example 1

```
n = 5, k = 3
p = (n-1) % k = 4 % 3 = 1
Residue pairs: {0,1}, {2}
Force B[0] = 1 ⇒ B[1] must also be 1 (paired with 0). Set the rest to 0.
So B = [1,1,0] = "110"
Build S by repeating B and taking n=5 chars: 1 1 0 1 1 ⇒ "11011"
"11011" is a palindrome, starts with 1, and zeros are maximized.
```

### Example 2

```
n = 6, k = 1
p = (n-1) % k = 5 % 1 = 0
Pair {0} only. B[0] = 1.
S = '1' repeated 6 times ⇒ "111111"
```

### Extra check

```
n = 4, k = 3
p = (n-1) % k = 3 % 3 = 0
Only residue 0 is forced to 1. Others → 0.  B = "100"
S (first 4 chars of repeating "100"): 1 0 0 1 ⇒ "1001" (palindrome).
```

# 3) Python solutions (brute for intuition + optimized)

### A) Brute force (conceptual, good for explaining approach; only works for very small k)

Try all `2^(k-1)` blocks of length `k` that start with `1`, build the length-`n` prefix, keep the palindromes, and return the one with the most zeros.

```python
# Brute-force version for small k (teaching/intuition). Not for large constraints.
class SolutionBrute:
    def binaryPalindrome(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        # Enumerate all blocks B (length k) with B[0] = '1'.
        # For each, build the length-n string S[i] = B[i % k],
        # keep S if it's a palindrome, choose the one with max zero count.
        if k <= 0 or n <= 0:
            return "-1"

        best = None
        best_zeros = -1

        # Bits for positions 1..k-1 (position 0 is forced to 1)
        limit = 1 << max(0, k - 1)
        for mask in range(limit):
            B = ['1'] + ['0'] * (k - 1)
            for j in range(k - 1):
                if (mask >> j) & 1:
                    B[j + 1] = '1'

            # Build candidate S
            S = ''.join(B[i % k] for i in range(n))

            # Check palindrome
            if S == S[::-1]:
                zeros = S.count('0')
                if zeros > best_zeros:
                    best_zeros = zeros
                    best = S

        return best if best is not None else "-1"
```

### B) Optimized O(n) construction (what interviewers expect)

Derives directly from the pairing rule above. No need to materialize the entire block.

```python
class Solution:
    def binaryPalindrome(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        # We want a k-periodic palindrome S of length n, with as many zeros as possible,
        # and the k-length block starts with '1' (i.e., residue 0 is '1').
        #
        # Let p = (n - 1) % k. By palindromic constraints, residue 0 is paired with residue p,
        # so both must be equal; since the block must start with '1', we set residues {0, p} to '1'
        # and all other residues to '0' to maximize zeros.
        #
        # Thus, for every position i, S[i] = '1' iff i % k in {0, p}; otherwise '0'.

        if n <= 0 or k <= 0:
            return "-1"

        p = (n - 1) % k

        # Build answer directly in O(n), O(1) extra space (aside from output).
        res_chars = []
        for i in range(n):
            r = i % k
            res_chars.append('1' if r == 0 or r == p else '0')

        return ''.join(res_chars)
```

**Complexity (optimized):**
Time `O(n)` (single pass to fill the string)
Extra space `O(1)` beyond the output string.

# 4) Interviewer-style Q&A

**Q1. Why must the final string be k-periodic?**
Because it’s formed by repeating a block `B` of length `k` (trimming allows dropping only trailing zeros; the final kept part is still a prefix of a k-periodic infinite string).

**Q2. How do you combine k-periodicity with the palindrome constraint?**
Let `S[i] = B[i % k]`. For a palindrome, `S[i] = S[n-1-i]` for all `i`. Hence
`B[i % k] = B[(n-1-i) % k]`.
Define `f(a) = (n-1-a) % k`. Then each residue class `a` must match its partner `f(a)`. This partitions residues into disjoint pairs (or singletons if `a = f(a)`).

**Q3. How do you maximize zeros under these constraints?**
The only forced 1 is `B[0] = '1'` (the block starts with 1). Its partner `p = f(0) = (n-1) % k` must also be `'1'`. Set **all other residue classes to `'0'`**. That satisfies all equalities and maximizes zero count.

**Q4. Is a solution always possible? When would you return `-1`?**
Under the stated rules (block length `k` starts with `1`, repetition, allowed to trim trailing zeros), a solution **always exists**: set residues `{0, p}` to `1` and all others to `0`. Hence `-1` should not occur for valid inputs (`n, k ≥ 1`). Returning `-1` is mostly a guard for invalid inputs.

**Q5. What if `p = 0`? (i.e., `k` divides `n-1`)**
Then the partner of residue `0` is itself. You only need `B[0] = '1'`; all other residues can be `0`. For example `n=4, k=3` → `B="100"` → `S="1001"`.

**Q6. Does trimming trailing zeros matter for your construction?**
Our construction directly builds the first `n` characters of the infinite repetition, which is already a palindrome. Trimming is optional and never hurts; if the next characters were zeros, trimming would simply remove them.

**Q7. Can you justify the time and space complexity?**
We compute `p` in `O(1)` and fill `n` characters by checking if `i % k` is in `{0, p}`—that’s `O(n)` time. We don’t allocate the whole block; we compute directly, so extra space is `O(1)` besides the output.

**Q8. Any alternative viewpoint (number theory flavor)?**
Yes. The equalities identify each residue with its reflection modulo `k`. Since `f` is an involution, each orbit has size ≤ 2. You assign exactly one bit per orbit; the orbit containing 0 is forced to 1, others to 0 to maximize zeros.

**Q9. What edge cases would you test?**

* `n=1` (answer is `"1"` for any `k`)
* `k=1` (answer is `"1"*n`)
* `n < k` (still works; we just take the prefix)
* Even/odd `n` with random `k` to verify symmetry
* Large `n` with large `k` for performance

# 6) Real-World Use Cases (most relevant)

* **Hardware/FPGA test patterns:** Generate deterministic, mirror-symmetric bitstreams with maximal zeros for stressing serializer/deserializer links and verifying reflection symmetry in pipelines.
* **Network frame templates:** Create palindromic, low-density (zero-heavy) header/payload templates that are easy to detect and validate for loopback/echo diagnostics.
* **Error-detection fixtures:** Palindromic patterns simplify boundary checks (prefix equals reversed suffix) in storage/memory tests while minimizing energy due to fewer ‘1’ bits.
* **Data compression benchmarking:** Construct controlled, periodic palindromes to probe worst/best-case behavior in run-length or dictionary compressors under symmetric, sparse-1 inputs.
