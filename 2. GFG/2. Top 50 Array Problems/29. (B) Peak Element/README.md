Given an array `arr[]` where no two adjacent elements are same, find the **index of a peak element**.
An element is considered to be a **peak** if it is greater than its adjacent elements (if they exist).
If there are multiple peak elements, return index of any one of them.

The output will be **"true"** if the index returned by your function is correct; otherwise, it will be **"false"**.

**Note:** Consider the element **before the first** element and the element **after the last** element to be negative infinity.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3]`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** `arr[5] = 8` is a peak element because `arr[4] < arr[5] > arr[6]`.

### Example 2

**Input:** `arr = [10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 80]`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** `arr[1] = 20` and `arr[5] = 90` are peak elements because `arr[0] < arr[1] > arr[2]` and `arr[4] < arr[5] > arr[6]`.

### Example 3

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2, 3]`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** `arr[2]` is a peak element because `arr[1] < arr[2]` and `arr[2]` is the last element, so it has negative infinity to its right.

Here‚Äôs your complete solution to the **Peak Element** problem in four parts:

---

## üìò 1. Text Explanation

A **peak element** in an array is an element that is **strictly greater** than its neighbors. You need to return **any one** such index.

### Special Conditions:

* The first element has only the right neighbor.
* The last element has only the left neighbor.
* Elements before the first and after the last are considered `-‚àû` (negative infinity).

---

## üîç 2. Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Input:

```python
arr = [10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 80]
```

### Binary Search-based Dry Run:

* `start = 0`, `end = 6`

* `mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3 ‚Üí arr[3] = 2`
  ‚Üí `arr[3] < arr[4]`, so peak must be in **right half**.

* `start = 4`, `end = 6`

* `mid = (4 + 6) // 2 = 5 ‚Üí arr[5] = 90`
  ‚Üí `arr[5] > arr[4]` and `arr[5] > arr[6]`
  ‚úÖ Found a **peak** at index 5 ‚Üí return 5

### üîπ Brute Force (Not recommended in interviews unless explicitly asked)

```python
class Solution:   
    def peakElement(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            left = float('-inf') if i == 0 else arr[i - 1]
            right = float('-inf') if i == n - 1 else arr[i + 1]
            if arr[i] > left and arr[i] > right:
                return i  # Peak element found
        return -1
```

* üß† Space: O(1)

### üî∏ Optimized Binary Search (Interview Preferred ‚Äî O(log n))

```python
class Solution:   
    def peakElement(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        start, end = 0, n - 1

        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2

            # Get neighbors safely
            left = float('-inf') if mid == 0 else arr[mid - 1]
            right = float('-inf') if mid == n - 1 else arr[mid + 1]

            # Check peak condition
            if arr[mid] >= left and arr[mid] >= right:
                return mid
            elif arr[mid] < right:
                start = mid + 1  # Move right
            else:
                end = mid - 1    # Move left

## üß† 4. Interview Questions & Answers

---

### ‚ùì Q1: Why is binary search applicable here?

**A:** Because we can discard half of the array each time:

* If `arr[mid] < arr[mid+1]`, then a peak **must** exist on the right.
* If `arr[mid] < arr[mid-1]`, then a peak **must** exist on the left.

---

### ‚ùì Q2: Can there be multiple peaks?

**A:** Yes. The problem allows returning **any one** of them.

---

### ‚ùì Q3: What are edge cases?

* Single-element array ‚Üí It is always a peak
* Increasing array ‚Üí Last element is the peak
* Decreasing array ‚Üí First element is the peak

---

### ‚ùì Q4: What‚Äôs the difference between this and "maximum element"?

**A:** The **maximum element** must be the greatest overall.
A **peak** is only required to be greater than its immediate neighbors.

---

### ‚ùì Q5: What if adjacent elements are equal?

**A:** The problem states **no two adjacent elements are the same**, so this case won't happen.

```python

class Solution:   
    def peakElement(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        start, end = 0, n - 1

        # Step 1: Binary Search Loop
        # Time Complexity: O(log n) ‚Äî halves the search space each iteration
        # Space Complexity: O(1) ‚Äî constant space used
        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2

            # Step 2: Define neighbors with edge protection
            # Time: O(1) per access
            left = float('-inf') if mid == 0 else arr[mid - 1]
            right = float('-inf') if mid == n - 1 else arr[mid + 1]

            # Step 3: Peak Check
            if arr[mid] >= left and arr[mid] >= right:
                return mid  # Found a peak

            # Step 4: Decide search direction
            elif arr[mid] < right:
                start = mid + 1  # Move to right half
            else:
                end = mid - 1    # Move to left half

        return -1  # This shouldn't happen as a peak is guaranteed
