Great choiceâ€”postorder is the one where you visit **Left â†’ Right â†’ Root**. Hereâ€™s a crisp walk-through, then multiple interview-ready solutions, and finally a compact Q\&A.

---

## 2) Text explanation + step-by-step dry run

### What is postorder?

For every node:

1. Traverse its left subtree (postorder).
2. Traverse its right subtree (postorder).
3. Visit (append) the node itself.

This is perfect for problems where you need children processed before the parent (e.g., freeing memory, evaluating expression trees).

### Dry run on this tree

```
        19
       /  \
     10    8
    /  \
   11   13
```

Call `postOrder(19)`

* Recurse left â†’ `postOrder(10)`

  * Recurse left â†’ `postOrder(11)`

    * 11 has no children â‡’ output 11
  * Recurse right â†’ `postOrder(13)`

    * 13 has no children â‡’ output 13
  * Visit 10 â‡’ output 10
* Recurse right â†’ `postOrder(8)`

  * 8 has no children â‡’ output 8
* Visit 19 â‡’ output 19

Final order: **\[11, 13, 10, 8, 19]** âœ…

## 3) Optimized Python solutions (interview-friendly)

All variants return a list of node values in postorder.

### A) Recursion (clean & canonical)

* Time: O(n) â€” each node visited once
* Space: O(h) â€” recursion stack height (h = tree height; O(n) in worst case, O(log n) for balanced)

```python
'''
# Node Class:
class Node:
    def __init__(self,val):
        self.data = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
'''
class Solution:
    # Function to return a list containing the postorder traversal of the tree.
    def postOrder(self, root):
        # Left -> Right -> Root
        out = []

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return
            dfs(node.left)          # visit left subtree
            dfs(node.right)         # visit right subtree
            out.append(node.data)   # visit node
        dfs(root)
        return out
```

### B) Iterative using **two stacks** (most common iterative pattern)

* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n) for stacks and output

```python
class Solution:
    def postOrder(self, root):
        if not root:
            return []
        s1, s2 = [root], []   # s1: process stack, s2: results in reverse
        while s1:
            node = s1.pop()
            s2.append(node)
            # Push left and right so that when s2 is popped, order becomes Left, Right, Root
            if node.left:
                s1.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                s1.append(node.right)
        # s2 has nodes in Root, Right, Left -> reverse pop gives Left, Right, Root
        return [node.data for node in reversed(s2)]
```

### C) Iterative using **one stack** (trickier but space-friendly)

* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(h) average (stack of path)

Idea: Go left as far as possible, then peek: if right child exists and not processed, go right; otherwise process node.

```python
class Solution:
    def postOrder(self, root):
        out = []
        stack = []
        last_visited = None
        curr = root

        while curr or stack:
            # 1) Go as left as possible
            if curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            else:
                node = stack[-1]
                # 2) If right child exists and not yet visited, go right
                if node.right and last_visited is not node.right:
                    curr = node.right
                else:
                    # 3) Visit node
                    out.append(node.data)
                    last_visited = node
                    stack.pop()
        return out
```

## 4) Likely interviewer Q\&A

**Q1. Whatâ€™s the time and space complexity of postorder traversal?**
**A.** Time is **O(n)** (each node once). Space is **O(h)** for recursion/stack where **h** is tree height (O(n) worst, O(log n) balanced).

**Q2. When would you prefer iterative over recursive?**
**A.** When recursion depth may exceed call stack (degenerate trees), or when recursion is disallowed. The two-stack method is the easiest iterative approach.

**Q3. Can we do postorder in one stack?**
**A.** Yesâ€”track `last_visited` to know whether youâ€™ve already processed the right subtree of the top node. (See solution C.)

**Q4. Why is postorder useful?**
**A.** Parent depends on results of children: expression evaluation, deleting/freeing tree nodes, bottom-up dynamic programming on trees.

**Q5. How would you modify code to return nodes instead of values?**
**A.** Append `out.append(node)` instead of `node.data`.

**Q6. How to handle empty tree?**
**A.** Return `[]`. All variants do that.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (most important)

1. **Expression tree evaluation / code generation**
   Postorder naturally computes child values before the operator node (parent), matching evaluation order.

2. **Resource cleanup / dependency teardown**
   When an object depends on its children (files in directories, tasks with prerequisites), postorder frees/destroys children before the parent.

3. **Bottom-up dynamic programming on trees**
   Many DP-on-tree problems (e.g., compute subtree sums, choose best subtree) require children processed first.

4. **Filesystem operations**
   Deleting a directory tree safely uses postorder: delete files/subdirs first, then the directory itself.
