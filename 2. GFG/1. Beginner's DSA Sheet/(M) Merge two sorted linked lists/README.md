## üîç Problem Description

You are given the **head** of two **sorted linked lists** consisting of nodes.
Your task is to **merge** both linked lists into one **sorted linked list** and return the head of the merged list.

---

## üß™ Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
head1 = 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 40  
head2 = 2 -> 3 -> 20
```

**Output:**

```
2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 40
```

**Explanation:**

* We merge two lists into one by comparing values:

  * 2 < 5 ‚Üí pick 2
  * 3 < 5 ‚Üí pick 3
  * 5 < 10 ‚Üí pick 5
  * ...continue in sorted order
* The merged list is: `2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 40`

üñº Visual Representation:

```
List1:     5 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 40  
List2:     2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 20  

Merged:    2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 40
```

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
head1 = 1 -> 1  
head2 = 2 -> 4
```

**Output:**

```
1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4
```

üñº Visual Representation:

```
List1:     1 ‚Üí 1  
List2:     2 ‚Üí 4  

Merged:    1 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 4
```

---

## üîê Constraints

* `1 ‚â§ list1.size, list2.size ‚â§ 10¬≥`
* `0 ‚â§ node.data ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Expected Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)` where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two linked lists.
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)` (in-place merge, ignoring the output list space).

Thanks for your patience. Based on the problem pattern in the screenshot and your question, you're referring to applying multiple range update operations efficiently on a 2D matrix ‚Äî a problem usually solved with a **2D difference array** technique.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Text Explanation with Step-by-Step Dry Run

### **Problem Summary:**

Given a 2D matrix `mat` of size `n x m` initialized with 0s and a list of operations `opr`, where each operation `[r1, c1, r2, c2, val]` adds `val` to every cell from `(r1, c1)` to `(r2, c2)`, apply all operations efficiently and return the updated matrix.

### **Naive Approach:**

* For each operation, iterate over all cells in the submatrix and increment each by `val`.
* **Time Complexity: O(q \* n \* m)** ‚Äî Too slow for large inputs.

### **Optimized (Difference Array Approach):**

* Maintain a 2D **difference matrix** `diff` of same size.
* For each operation `[r1, c1, r2, c2, val]`, update `diff` using:

  ```
  diff[r1][c1] += val
  diff[r1][c2 + 1] -= val
  diff[r2 + 1][c1] -= val
  diff[r2 + 1][c2 + 1] += val
  ```
* Then compute **prefix sums row-wise and column-wise** to build the final matrix.

### **Dry Run:**

**Input:** `n = 3, m = 3`, `operations = [[0,0,1,1,5], [1,1,2,2,10]]`

Initial matrix:

```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

After applying operations using difference matrix:

```
+5 at (0,0), -5 at (0,2), -5 at (2,0), +5 at (2,2)
+10 at (1,1), -10 at (1,3), -10 at (3,1), +10 at (3,3)
```

Build the prefix sums on the `diff` matrix to get final values.

## ‚úÖ 3. Optimized Python Code (Expected in Interviews)

```python
class Solution:
    def applyDiff2D(self, n, m, operations):
        import time
        start = time.time()  # Start timer

        # Step 1: Initialize 2D difference matrix
        diff = [[0] * (m + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]

        # Step 2: Apply operations using 2D difference update
        for r1, c1, r2, c2, val in operations:
            diff[r1][c1] += val
            diff[r1][c2 + 1] -= val
            diff[r2 + 1][c1] -= val
            diff[r2 + 1][c2 + 1] += val

        # Step 3: Row-wise prefix sum
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                diff[i][j] += diff[i][j - 1]

        # Step 4: Column-wise prefix sum
        for j in range(m):
            for i in range(1, n):
                diff[i][j] += diff[i - 1][j]

        # Step 5: Extract final matrix
        result = [[diff[i][j] for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]

        end = time.time()  # End timer
        print("Execution Time:", end - start, "seconds")

        return result
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Run

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    n, m = 3, 3
    operations = [[0, 0, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 2, 2, 10]]
    result = sol.applyDiff2D(n, m, operations)
    print("Final Matrix:")
    for row in result:
        print(row)
```

**Output:**

```
Final Matrix:
[5, 5, 0]
[5, 15, 10]
[0, 10, 10]
```

## ‚úÖ 4. Interview Q\&A

### Q1: Why is the 2D difference array approach preferred over the naive approach?

**A:** It reduces time complexity from O(Q \* N \* M) to O(Q + N\*M), which is critical for handling large-scale updates efficiently.

---

### Q2: How do you handle overlapping updates efficiently?

**A:** The 2D difference array naturally accumulates overlapping updates and prefix sums spread them correctly.

---

### Q3: What edge cases do you need to handle?

* Operations going out of bounds
* Empty operation list
* Zero-length matrix

```python
import time

# Node class for linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Solution class containing the merging method
class Solution:
    def sortedMerge(self, head1, head2):
        """
        Merge two sorted linked lists in-place.
        Time Complexity: O(n + m)
        Space Complexity: O(1)
        """
        dummy = Node(-1)  # dummy node to simplify logic
        tail = dummy

        # Merge until either list is exhausted
        while head1 and head2:
            if head1.data < head2.data:
                tail.next = head1
                head1 = head1.next
            else:
                tail.next = head2
                head2 = head2.next
            tail = tail.next

        # Append the remaining part
        if head1:
            tail.next = head1
        elif head2:
            tail.next = head2

        return dummy.next

# Helper function to print a linked list
def printList(node):
    result = []
    while node:
        result.append(str(node.data))
        node = node.next
    print(" -> ".join(result))

# Helper to create a linked list from a list
def createList(arr):
    """
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n) to store nodes
    """
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = Node(arr[0])
    current = head
    for value in arr[1:]:
        current.next = Node(value)
        current = current.next
    return head

# Main Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    list1 = [5, 10, 15, 40]
    list2 = [2, 3, 20]

    head1 = createList(list1)

    end_time = time.time()

    print("Merged Linked List:")
    printList(merged_head)
    print(f"\nExecution Time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds")
```

---

### ‚úÖ Input:

```python
list1 = [5, 10, 15, 40]
list2 = [2, 3, 20]
```

### ‚úÖ Output:

```
Merged Linked List:
2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 40

Execution Time: 0.000006 seconds
```

---

### üîç Time and Space Complexity:

* **Time:** O(n + m) where `n` and `m` are sizes of the two lists.
* **Space:** O(1) extra (ignoring input lists, as we reuse the nodes).

# üåç Real-World Use Cases

Here are **a few important real-world use cases** where merging two sorted linked lists (or sorted sequences in general) is critical:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Merging Sorted Logs or Data Streams (System Monitoring, ETL Pipelines)**

* **Scenario:** Two sorted server logs or sensor streams (by timestamp) need to be merged into a single timeline.
* **Why Linked Lists?**

  * If each log is dynamically growing or stored in a linked data format (e.g., in-memory), merging them while maintaining order is crucial.
* **Example:** In ELK (Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana) pipelines or AWS Kinesis streams.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Merge Phase in External Merge Sort (Big Data)**

* **Scenario:** Data too large to fit into memory is split, sorted in parts, and merged.
* **Why Linked Lists?**

  * In I/O-constrained systems, sorted runs on disk can be streamed and merged efficiently using pointers (like linked lists).
* **Example:** Hadoop MapReduce merge phase; database index merging.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Version Control Systems (Git Merge Internals)**

* **Scenario:** Git merges two sorted commit histories.
* **Why Linked Lists?**

  * Commits are linked via pointers (commit DAGs), and merging two linear histories resembles merging sorted linked structures.
* **Example:** Merging branches with minimal conflicts.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Scheduling and Calendar Management**

* **Scenario:** Merging multiple users' sorted calendar events for finding mutual availability.
* **Why Linked Lists?**

  * Events are sorted by time and are iterated/merged to detect overlaps or gaps.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **K-Way Merge in Search Engines / Inverted Indexing**

* **Scenario:** Merging sorted lists of document IDs that contain a query term.
* **Why Linked Lists?**

  * Posting lists are often stored as sorted linked structures for efficient query processing.
* **Example:** Lucene, Elasticsearch, Google Search backend.
