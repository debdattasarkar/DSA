## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if the **k-th** index bit of `n` is set or not.

**Note:**
A bit is called **set** if it is `1`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
n = 4, k = 0
```

**Output:**

```
false
```

**Explanation:**
Binary representation of 4 is `100`, in which the `0`th index bit from **LSB** is **not** set.
So, return **false**.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
n = 4, k = 2
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

**Explanation:**
Binary representation of 4 is `100`, in which the `2`nd index bit from **LSB** is set.
So, return **true**.

---

### Example 3

**Input:**

```
n = 500, k = 3
```

**Output:**

```
false
```

**Explanation:**
Binary representation of 500 is `111110100`, in which the `3`rd index bit from **LSB** is **not** set.
So, return **false**.

## Constraints

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^9$
* $0 \leq k \leq 31$

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$
* **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

# 2) Explanation + Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Dry Run

## What are we checking?

Given integers `n` and `k`, we need to check whether the **k‚Äëth bit from the right (LSB)** in the binary representation of `n` is `1` (set) or `0` (not set).
Indexing is **0‚Äëbased** from the **LSB**:

* `k = 0` ‚Üí least significant bit
* `k = 1` ‚Üí next bit, and so on.

## Two classic ways

1. **Mask & AND**
   Create a mask that has only the k‚Äëth bit set: `mask = 1 << k`.
   If `(n & mask) != 0` ‚Üí k‚Äëth bit is set; else not set.

2. **Right‚Äëshift & AND**
   Right shift `n` by `k` positions: `n >> k`.
   If `((n >> k) & 1) == 1` ‚Üí k‚Äëth bit is set; else not set.

Both are `O(1)` time, `O(1)` space.

### Dry run (short)

* Example 1: `n = 4 (100‚ÇÇ)`, `k = 0`
  `mask = 1 << 0 = 1 (001‚ÇÇ)`
  `n & mask = 100‚ÇÇ & 001‚ÇÇ = 000‚ÇÇ = 0` ‚Üí **False**.

* Example 2: `n = 4 (100‚ÇÇ)`, `k = 2`
  `mask = 1 << 2 = 4 (100‚ÇÇ)`
  `n & mask = 100‚ÇÇ & 100‚ÇÇ = 100‚ÇÇ ‚â† 0` ‚Üí **True**.

* Example 3: `n = 500 (111110100‚ÇÇ)`, `k = 3`
  `mask = 1 << 3 = 8 (000001000‚ÇÇ)`
  `n & mask = 111110100‚ÇÇ & 000001000‚ÇÇ = 000000000‚ÇÇ = 0` ‚Üí **False**.

Edge case note: If `k` is ‚â• number of bits in `n`, the mask still works and the result is `False`.

```

# 4) Likely Interview Q\&A

**Q1. What‚Äôs the time and space complexity?**
A. Both `O(1)` time and `O(1)` space for bitwise approaches.

**Q2. What does `1 << k` do?**
A. It creates a number whose only set bit is at position `k`. Example: `1 << 3 = 8 (1000‚ÇÇ)`.

**Q3. Why does `(n & (1 << k)) != 0` work?**
A. The AND keeps only bits that are `1` in both operands. If the k‚Äëth bit in `n` is `1`, the result is nonzero; otherwise zero.

**Q4. What if `k` is larger than any set bit of `n`?**
A. The mask will have a bit outside `n`‚Äôs set bits; `n & mask` becomes `0`, so the answer is `False`.

**Q5. How do you **set**, **clear**, or **toggle** the k‚Äëth bit (bonus)?**

* Set: `n | (1 << k)`
* Clear: `n & ~(1 << k)`
* Toggle: `n ^ (1 << k)`

**Q6. Is Python‚Äôs shifting safe for large `k`?**
A. Yes‚ÄîPython integers are arbitrary precision; shifting just creates bigger integers. For this problem, `k ‚â§ 31`.

**Q7. What‚Äôs the bit indexing direction?**
A. From LSB (rightmost) with **0‚Äëbased** indexing.

## 6) Real‚ÄëWorld Use Cases (short list)

1. **Feature flags / permissions bits**
   Compactly store on/off states (e.g., user roles, toggles). Checking `k` is set answers ‚Äúdoes user have permission X?‚Äù.

2. **Network protocols & file formats**
   Many headers pack options into bit fields (e.g., TCP flags). Checking a bit determines if a flag/option is on.

3. **Embedded/IoT: hardware registers**
   Reading sensor/interrupt/status registers often means inspecting individual bits for events or error states.

4. **Compression/bitmap indices**
   Memory‚Äëefficient presence/absence tests‚Äîe.g., ‚Äúis item i present?‚Äù equals ‚Äúis bit i set?‚Äù.

5. **Game Dev & Graphics**
   Layer masks, collision masks, and rendering flags rely on fast bit checks per frame.

All of these lean on the exact same micro‚Äëoperation you implemented: **mask & AND** or **shift & AND** for constant‚Äëtime checks.
