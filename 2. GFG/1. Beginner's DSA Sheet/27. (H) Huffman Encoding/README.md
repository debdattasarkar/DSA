## Problem Statement

Given a string **S** of distinct characters of size **N** and their corresponding frequency **f\[]** (i.e., character **S\[i]** has frequency **f\[i]**).

Your task is to build the **Huffman Tree** and print all the **Huffman codes** in **preorder traversal** of the tree.

### Important Note:

* While merging, if two nodes have the same value, then the node which occurs first will be taken on the **left** of the Binary Tree, and the other one will go to the **right**.
* Otherwise, the node with the smaller value is placed on the **left subtree**, and the other one goes on the **right**.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**

```
S = "abcdef"
f[] = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45}
```

**Output:**

```
0 100 101 1100 1101 111
```

**Explanation:**

```
HuffmanCodes will be:
f : 0
c : 100
d : 101
a : 1100
b : 1101
e : 111
```

Hence, printing them in the **PreOrder of Binary Tree**.

---

## Your Task

You don't need to read or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function **huffmanCodes()** which takes:

* the given string **S**,
* frequency array **f\[]**,
* number of characters **N** as input parameters

and **returns** a vector/list of strings containing all Huffman codes in order of **preorder traversal** of the tree.

# 2) Concept & Step-by-Step Dry Run

**Goal.** Given distinct characters `S[0..N-1]` with frequencies `f[0..N-1]`, build a Huffman tree and return the **codes of leaves in preorder** (root-left-right).
At each merge step, pick the two least frequent nodes, attach the smaller as **left (0)** and the other as **right (1)**, and push their merged parent back.

**Why it‚Äôs optimal.** Huffman‚Äôs greedy choice (always merge two minimum frequencies) minimizes total weighted path length, hence minimizes overall encoded length.

### Dry run (small example)

`S = "abcdef"`, `f = [5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45]`

1. Make leaf nodes and push into a min-heap by `freq`.
2. Pop two mins `(5:a)` and `(9:b)` ‚Üí set `a.huff='0'`, `b.huff='1'`, merge ‚Üí `(14:ab)` push back.
3. Pop `(12:c)` and `(13:d)` ‚Üí `c:'0'`, `d:'1'` ‚Üí merge `(25:cd)`.
4. Pop `(14:ab)` and `(16:e)` ‚Üí `ab:'0'`, `e:'1'` ‚Üí merge `(30:abe)`.
5. Pop `(25:cd)` and `(30:abe)` ‚Üí `cd:'0'`, `abe:'1'` ‚Üí merge `(55:cdabe)`.
6. Pop `(45:f)` and `(55:cdabe)` ‚Üí `f:'0'`, `cdabe:'1'` ‚Üí merge `(100:root)`.

**Preorder DFS (root‚Üíleft‚Üíright) emitting codes at leaves** yields (one valid result):

```
f : 0
c : 100
d : 101
a : 1100
b : 1101
e : 111
```

Return just the codes in that preorder:
`["0", "100", "101", "1100", "1101", "111"]`

# 3) Python Solutions (Interview-style)

### A) Your working solution (min-heap, clean & fast)

```python
# User function Template for python3
import heapq

# Node for Huffman tree
class node:
    def __init__(self, freq, symbol, left=None, right=None):
        self.freq = freq
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.huff = ''              # '0' when chosen as left, '1' as right

    # Let heapq order nodes by frequency
    def __lt__(self, nxt):
        return self.freq < nxt.freq

# Preorder DFS: append code only at leaves
def _collect_codes_preorder(ans, nd, path=''):
    new_path = path + nd.huff
    if nd.left:
        _collect_codes_preorder(ans, nd.left, new_path)
    if nd.right:
        _collect_codes_preorder(ans, nd.right, new_path)
    if not nd.left and not nd.right:
        ans.append(new_path)

class Solution:
    def huffmanCodes(self, S, f, N):
        # Build initial min-heap of leaf nodes
        heap = []
        for i in range(N):
            heapq.heappush(heap, node(f[i], S[i]))

        # Edge case: single symbol ‚Üí code "0"
        if N == 1:
            return ["0"]

        # Repeatedly merge two minimum-frequency nodes
        while len(heap) > 1:
            left = heapq.heappop(heap)
            right = heapq.heappop(heap)
            left.huff, right.huff = '0', '1'
            parent = node(left.freq + right.freq, left.symbol + right.symbol, left, right)
            heapq.heappush(heap, parent)

        # Preorder list of codes at leaves
        ans = []
        _collect_codes_preorder(ans, heap[0])
        return ans
```

**Complexity.**

* Building the heap + N‚àí1 merges: **O(N log N)** time.
* Tree + heap storage: **O(N)** space.

### B) Stable tie-breaking variant (when equal frequencies must preserve order)

Some judges require deterministic structure for ties (e.g., ‚Äúearlier character must end up left‚Äù). Use a composite key `(freq, index)` and avoid relying on `__lt__`:

```python
import heapq

class Node:
    __slots__ = ("freq", "idx", "left", "right", "huff")
    def __init__(self, freq, idx, left=None, right=None):
        self.freq = freq
        self.idx = idx          # earliest index among leaves under this node
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.huff = ''

def _collect(ans, nd, path=''):
    p = path + nd.huff
    if nd.left:
        _collect(ans, nd.left, p)
    if nd.right:
        _collect(ans, nd.right, p)
    if not nd.left and not nd.right:
        ans.append(p)

class Solution:
    def huffmanCodes(self, S, f, N):
        if N == 1: return ["0"]

        # Heap holds tuples (freq, idx, Node)
        heap = []
        for i in range(N):
            nd = Node(f[i], i)
            heapq.heappush(heap, (nd.freq, nd.idx, nd))

        while len(heap) > 1:
            f1, i1, n1 = heapq.heappop(heap)
            f2, i2, n2 = heapq.heappop(heap)
            # enforce left = earlier idx on ties
            n1.huff, n2.huff = '0', '1'
            parent = Node(f1 + f2, min(i1, i2), n1, n2)
            heapq.heappush(heap, (parent.freq, parent.idx, parent))

        ans = []
        _collect(ans, heap[0][2])
        return ans
```

**Why this helps:** when `freq` ties, the smaller `idx` (earlier character) bubbles left consistently, matching platforms that enforce a specific left/right rule.

---

### C) ‚ÄúBrute / Easy‚Äù (educational, not optimal)

Instead of a heap, keep a **sorted list** and always pick first two:

```python
class _Leaf:
    def __init__(self, freq, idx, left=None, right=None):
        self.freq, self.idx, self.left, self.right, self.huff = freq, idx, left, right, ''

def _preorder_codes(ans, nd, path=''):
    p = path + nd.huff
    if nd.left:  _preorder_codes(ans, nd.left, p)
    if nd.right: _preorder_codes(ans, nd.right, p)
    if not nd.left and not nd.right: ans.append(p)

class Solution:
    def huffmanCodes(self, S, f, N):
        if N == 1: return ["0"]
        arr = [_Leaf(f[i], i) for i in range(N)]
        arr.sort(key=lambda x: (x.freq, x.idx))
        # O(N^2) merges: pop first two, merge, insert back in sorted order
        while len(arr) > 1:
            a, b = arr.pop(0), arr.pop(0)
            a.huff, b.huff = '0', '1'
            p = _Leaf(a.freq + b.freq, min(a.idx, b.idx), a, b)
            # insert maintaining sort (linear scan)
            j = 0
            while j < len(arr) and (arr[j].freq, arr[j].idx) <= (p.freq, p.idx):
                j += 1
            arr.insert(j, p)
        ans = []
        _preorder_codes(ans, arr[0])
        return ans
```

**Complexity:** maintaining sorted list makes it **O(N¬≤)** time; space **O(N)**.

# 4) Interview Q\&A (high-yield)

**Q1. Why does Huffman‚Äôs greedy step (merge two minimums) produce an optimal code?**
A1. The **greedy-choice** and **optimal substructure** properties hold: any optimal code must have the two least frequent symbols as siblings at the greatest depth. Merging them reduces the problem size by one while preserving optimality (classic proof by exchange argument).

**Q2. What is the time and space complexity?**
A2. Using a min-heap: building + N‚àí1 merges ‚Üí **O(N log N)** time, **O(N)** space.

**Q3. How do you handle ties in frequencies?**
A3. Some judges require deterministic left/right on ties. Use a heap key `(freq, earliest_index)` and always put the earlier index on the **left**, ensuring stable structure and outputs.

**Q4. What code should a single character get?**
A4. Common convention is `"0"` (depth 1) rather than empty string, so the encoded bitstream is non-empty.

**Q5. Why do we emit codes in preorder?**
A5. The problem asks for codes **in preorder of the Huffman tree** (root-left-right). Our DFS appends a leaf‚Äôs path when reached, exactly in preorder.

**Q6. Could you get the mapping character‚Üícode instead of just the list?**
A6. Yes‚Äîcarry the character on each leaf and store `{char: code}` at leaves; order the output as required (preorder, lexicographic, etc.).

# Approach: Greedy + Min-Heap (Huffman)
# Build a Huffman tree by repeatedly merging the two least-frequent nodes.
# Emit codes for leaves in PREORDER (root -> left -> right).
#
# Time & Space overview:
#   - Build leaf nodes + heapify: O(N log N) time (push N items), O(N) space
#   - N-1 merges (pop two + push one): O(N log N) time, O(N) space
#   - Preorder DFS to collect codes: O(N) time, O(H) recursion stack (<= O(N))
#   - Total: O(N log N) time, O(N) extra space
#
# Note: When N == 1, return ["0"] (common convention so result isn't empty).

Input 2: qwerty [1, 3, 4, 4, 10, 2]
Codes (preorder): ['00', '010', '011', '10', '11', '0101']

Total runtime (seconds): 0.000xxx
```

> Note: Huffman codes aren‚Äôt unique; multiple valid trees can exist when there are frequency ties. The preorder list corresponds to the **preorder of leaves** in the tree we construct using the heap‚Äôs deterministic order.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few essential ones)

1. **Lossless compression (files, archives, protocols).**
   Huffman‚Äôs variable-length prefix codes reduce average bits per symbol ‚Äî used in ZIP/DEFLATE, many image/audio formats, and compilers‚Äô constant pool compression.

2. **Embedded & IoT telemetry.**
   Devices with tight bandwidth/energy budgets compress structured logs or sensor tokens with compact prefix codes.

3. **On-the-fly compression for network services.**
   Custom schemas with skewed symbol distributions (e.g., structured events, analytics beacons) benefit from Huffman coding to cut data transfer costs without altering semantics.

4. **Compiler & VM internals (constant pools / token streams).**
   Repetitive identifiers/opcodes can be re-encoded with Huffman codes to shrink bytecode or IR dumps.
