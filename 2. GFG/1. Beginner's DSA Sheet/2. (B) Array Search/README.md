## Problem Statement

Given an array, `arr` of `n` integers, and an integer element `x`, find whether element `x` is present in the array.
Return the index of the **first occurrence** of `x` in the array, or **-1 if it doesn't exist**.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3  
Output: 2  
Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3, 4] and element to be searched as 3.  
Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5  
Output: 4  
Explanation: For array [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], the element to be searched is 5 and it is at index 4.
So, the output is 4.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30], x = 6  
Output: -1  
Explanation: The element to be searched is 6 and it's not present, so we return -1.
```

* $0 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 10^6$
* $0 \leq x \leq 10^5$

## ‚úÖ 2. Text Explanation

You are given an integer array `arr[]` and an integer `x`. Your task is to find the **first occurrence index** of `x` in the array.
If the element does **not exist**, return `-1`.

This is a **classic linear search** problem. Since the array is not sorted, you have to scan from **left to right**, checking each element until you find a match.

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Example

```
arr = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5

Step 1: i = 0 ‚Üí arr[0] = 10 ‚â† 5 ‚Üí continue
Step 2: i = 1 ‚Üí arr[1] = 8 ‚â† 5 ‚Üí continue
Step 3: i = 2 ‚Üí arr[2] = 30 ‚â† 5 ‚Üí continue
Step 4: i = 3 ‚Üí arr[3] = 4 ‚â† 5 ‚Üí continue
Step 5: i = 4 ‚Üí arr[4] = 5 == x ‚Üí return 4

‚úÖ Output: 4
```

## üßæ 3. Optimized Python Code (Expected in Interviews)

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, arr, x):
        """
        Perform linear search to find the first occurrence of x in arr.

        Time Complexity: O(n) - traverses the array once
        Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space used
        """
        for i in range(len(arr)):  # O(n)
            if arr[i] == x:        # O(1)
                return i           # first match found
        return -1                  # not found
```

### üîß Main Function with Input/Output

```python
import timeit

def main():
    arr = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5]
    x = 5

    sol = Solution()
    start = timeit.default_timer()
    result = sol.search(arr, x)
    end = timeit.default_timer()

    print("Input Array:", arr)
    print("Search Element:", x)
    print("First Occurrence Index:", result)
    print("Execution Time:", end - start, "seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":

## üí° Alternate Easy Pythonic Code (For discussion, not interview)

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, arr, x):
        # Try to use list.index() method
        try:
            return arr.index(x)  # Returns first occurrence
        except ValueError:
            return -1
```

üîÅ Same time complexity: `O(n)`
‚ùó **Note:** Interviewers may prefer the manual loop version for learning/debugging purposes.

## ‚ùì 4. Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: Why do we use linear search here?

**A:** Because the array is not sorted. Binary search only works on sorted arrays.

---

### Q2: What‚Äôs the time complexity?

**A:** O(n) in the worst case ‚Äî when the element is not present or is the last element.

---

### Q3: Can you reduce the space complexity?

**A:** It‚Äôs already O(1), which is optimal ‚Äî no extra memory is used.

---

### Q4: Can binary search be used?

**A:** No, unless the array is sorted. Since it's unsorted, binary search won't work correctly.

---

### Q5: How would you handle duplicates?

**A:** The current approach returns the **first occurrence**, which satisfies the problem requirement.

---

### Q6: How can you improve performance for frequent searches?

**A:** Use a dictionary (hashmap) to store value-to-index mappings in `O(n)` preprocessing time, then answer queries in `O(1)`.

# Binary Search version (Only if Array is Sorted)

### ‚úÖ Binary Search (for Sorted Arrays)

        Time Complexity: O(log n)
            - Logarithmic due to halving the search space every time.

            if arr[mid] == x:

            elif arr[mid] < x:

### üìå Interview Notes

* **When to use Binary Search?** Only when the array is sorted.
* **What if array is unsorted?** Use **Linear Search** (`O(n)`) instead.
* **Can this be recursive?** Yes. Recursion adds O(log n) stack space.
