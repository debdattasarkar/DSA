## ‚úÖ 2. Text Explanation with Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Problem Summary:

Given:

* Two positive integers `n` and `k`

Task:

* Find the highest power `x` such that $k^x \mid n!$ (i.e., `k^x` divides `n!` completely).

---

### üîç Key Idea:

To find the **maximum power `x`** such that $k^x \mid n!$:

1. Factor `k` into its **prime factorization**:
   $k = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \dots \times p_m^{a_m}$

2. For each prime factor $p_i$, compute how many times $p_i$ appears in `n!`:
   Use Legendre‚Äôs formula:
   $\text{power of } p_i \text{ in } n! = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p_i} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p_i^2} \right\rfloor + \dots$

3. For each $p_i$, compute $\left\lfloor \frac{\text{power of } p_i}{a_i} \right\rfloor$

4. The minimum across all such values is our answer $x$.

---

### üßÆ Dry Run: n = 10, k = 9

* `n! = 3628800`
* `k = 9 = 3^2`

1. Factor `k`: 9 ‚Üí $3^2$
2. Count power of `3` in `10!`:
   $\left\lfloor \frac{10}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{10}{9} \right\rfloor = 3 + 1 = 4$
3. Divide by power in `k`:
   $\left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor = 2$

‚úÖ Final Answer: 2

                    k //= i

## ‚úÖ 4. Common Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: Why use Legendre's formula for factorial prime power counting?

**A:** Because it efficiently calculates the exponent of a prime `p` in `n!` without computing `n!` itself.

---

### Q2: Why take the minimum of `power_in_fact // a_i`?

**A:** Because for $k^x = (p_1^{a_1} \cdot \ldots)^{x}$ to divide `n!`, each prime power $p_i^{a_i \cdot x}$ must be present in `n!`.

---

### Q3: Why is brute force infeasible for large `n`?

**A:** You cannot compute or store `n!` for large `n` (up to 1e5). Use prime power analysis instead.

# üåç Real-World Use Cases

Here are **a few important real-world use cases** where computing the **power of $k$ in $n!$** (i.e., the largest integer $x$ such that $k^x \mid n!$) is highly relevant:

---

### üß™ 1. **Cryptography & Modular Arithmetic**

* **Use Case:** RSA cryptosystems, secure hash algorithms.
* **Why relevant:** Many cryptographic systems rely on modular inverses, factorizations, or multiplicative properties of factorials modulo large primes. Efficiently computing how many times a prime power divides a factorial is essential in optimizing and securing these systems.

---

### üßÆ 2. **Combinatorics and Permutations**

* **Use Case:** Validating divisibility of permutation counts.
* **Why relevant:** In problems involving $\frac{n!}{k_1! \cdot k_2! \cdot \ldots}$, it's often useful to know how divisible $n!$ is by a certain number. This helps in simplifying results or checking divisibility constraints in large combinatorial counts.

---

### üìê 3. **Big Integer Division and Exact Factorization**

* **Use Case:** Scientific computing, exact arithmetic in symbolic math (like SymPy, Mathematica).
* **Why relevant:** Symbolic manipulation systems often compute with factorials and must determine whether a number divides another cleanly. Power-of-k divisibility checks ensure accurate simplification and canonicalization.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. **Competitive Programming & Algorithm Design**

* **Use Case:** Constraints-based validation in online judges.
* **Why relevant:** Efficient determination of such divisibility in factorials is a standard subroutine in many complex algorithmic problems involving primes, number theory, or DP with math.

---

### üî¨ 5. **Number Theory Research**

* **Use Case:** Investigations involving Legendre‚Äôs formula, prime density, and integer sequences.
* **Why relevant:** Knowing how often a number divides a factorial is key to studying properties of primes and their behavior in factorial-based constructions (like Wilson‚Äôs theorem, Lucas‚Äô theorem).
