# Number of Distinct Words with **K** Maximum Contiguous Vowels

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Accuracy:** 42.62% **Submissions:** 9K+ **Points:** 8

---

Given a number **N**, find the number of unique words consisting **only of lowercase English letters** and having **length N** that can be formed **with at most K contiguous vowels** (i.e., you cannot have a block of consecutive vowels longer than **K** anywhere in the word).

Return the answer **modulo 1,000,000,007**.

> Vowels are `{a, e, i, o, u}` (5 letters).
> Consonants are the remaining 21 lowercase letters.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```
N = 2
K = 0
```

**Output**

```
441
```

**Explanation**
At most `K = 0` contiguous vowels means **no vowels** are allowed.
Each position must be a consonant (21 choices), so total valid words = $21^2 = 441$.
Words like `"bc"`, `"cd"`, `"df"` are valid; `"ab"` is **not** valid (it has 1 vowel).

---

### Example 2

**Input**

```
N = 1
K = 1
```

**Output**

```
26
```

**Explanation**
With `K = 1`, a single vowel is allowed, so any single lowercase letter works.
Total = 26.

---

## Your Task

You **don’t** need to read input or print anything. Implement the function:

```
kvowelwords(N, K) -> int
```

which takes integers **N** and **K** and returns the number of valid words of size **N** with at most **K** **contiguous** vowels, **mod 1\_000\_000\_007**.

## Expected Time & Space

* **Expected Time Complexity:** `O(N * K)`
* **Expected Auxiliary Space:** `O(N * K)`

---

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ N ≤ 1000`
* `0 ≤ K ≤ N`

Here’s a clean way to think about this problem and solve it in interview-friendly Python.

## 2) Explanation + step-by-step dry run

### What we count

* Alphabet = 26 lower-case letters → **5 vowels** (`a,e,i,o,u`) and **21 consonants**.
* We need all strings of length **N** such that **no block of consecutive vowels is longer than K**.

### DP state (most common interview approach)

Let
`dp[i][j]` = number of valid strings of **length i** that **end** with **exactly j consecutive vowels**, where `0 ≤ j ≤ K`.

* `j = 0` means the i-th character is a consonant.
* `1 ≤ j ≤ K` means the last `j` chars are vowels and the char before that (if any) is a consonant or string start.

### Transitions

From all valid strings of length `i-1`:

1. **Append a consonant** (21 choices):
   This resets the trailing vowel run to 0.

   ```
   dp[i][0] = 21 * sum(dp[i-1][j] for j=0..K)
   ```

2. **Append a vowel** (5 choices):
   You can append a vowel only if previous trailing run `j-1` existed (and j-1 ≥ 0).
   For `j = 1..K`:

   ```
   dp[i][j] = 5 * dp[i-1][j-1]
   ```

Base:

```
dp[0][0] = 1   # empty string, ends with 0 consecutive vowels
dp[0][j>0] = 0
```

Answer:

```
ans = sum(dp[N][j] for j=0..K)  (mod 1e9+7)
```

We can compute this with **rolling arrays** (size `K+1`) to get **O(K)** space.

---

### Dry run 1 — N=2, K=0

Only consonants are allowed (no vowel blocks at all).

* i = 0: prev = \[1]
* i = 1:

  * sum(prev) = 1
  * curr\[0] = 21 \* 1 = 21
    → prev = \[21]
* i = 2:

  * sum(prev) = 21
  * curr\[0] = 21 \* 21 = 441
    → prev = \[441]

Answer = 441 ✅

---

### Dry run 2 — N=3, K=1

Vowel runs can be of length at most 1.

We keep arrays of length 2: index 0 (ends with consonant), index 1 (ends with 1 vowel).

* i = 0: prev = \[1, 0]

* i = 1:

  * S = 1
  * curr\[0] = 21\*S = 21
  * curr\[1] = 5*prev\[0] = 5*1 = 5
    → prev = \[21, 5]   (total = 26)

* i = 2:

  * S = 21+5 = 26
  * curr\[0] = 21\*26 = 546
  * curr\[1] = 5*prev\[0] = 5*21 = 105
    → prev = \[546, 105] (total = 651)

* i = 3:

  * S = 546+105 = 651
  * curr\[0] = 21\*651 = 13,671
  * curr\[1] = 5\*546  = 2,730
    → prev = \[13,671, 2,730] (total = **16,401**)

Answer = 16,401 (mod 1e9+7).
(You can also sanity-check: total strings = 26³=17,576; we’re excluding those with “vvv…” blocks of length ≥2.)

## 3) Optimized Python solutions (interview-style)

### A) Standard DP (O(N·K) time, O(K) space) — recommended

```python
#User function Template for python3
MOD = 1_000_000_007

class Solution:
    def kvowelwords(self, N, K):
        # Rolling DP over "j = number of trailing vowels"
        # prev[j] = count of length i-1 strings ending with j consecutive vowels
        prev = [0] * (K + 1)
        prev[0] = 1  # empty string
        
        for _ in range(1, N + 1):
            total_prev = sum(prev) % MOD
            curr = [0] * (K + 1)
            
            # Append a consonant -> resets trailing vowel run to 0
            curr[0] = (21 * total_prev) % MOD
            
            # Append a vowel -> j from 1..K
            for j in range(1, K + 1):
                curr[j] = (5 * prev[j - 1]) % MOD
            
            prev = curr
        
        return sum(prev) % MOD
```

**Why it’s optimal for interviews**

* State is intuitive and easy to explain.
* Time `O(N*K)` fits `N ≤ 1000`.
* Memory `O(K)` small and scalable.

---

### B) Same DP, slightly more compact (still O(N·K), O(K))

```python
MOD = 1_000_000_007

class Solution:
    def kvowelwords(self, N, K):
        ways = [0] * (K + 1)
        ways[0] = 1
        
        for _ in range(N):
            s = sum(ways) % MOD
            new = [0] * (K + 1)
            new[0] = (21 * s) % MOD
            for j in range(1, K + 1):
                new[j] = (5 * ways[j - 1]) % MOD
            ways = new
        
        return sum(ways) % MOD
```

---

### C) Brute-force (for understanding only; not for real inputs)

This demonstrates the **constraint** (no vowel run longer than K) using DFS. Complexity is exponential, only for tiny N (e.g., N ≤ 15) to reason about correctness.

```python
# Not for production; just conceptual
VOWELS = set("aeiou")

def brute_count(N, K):
    def ok(run):
        return run <= K
    
    def dfs(pos, run_vowel):
        if pos == N:
            return 1
        # Place consonant
        cnt = 21 * dfs(pos + 1, 0)
        # Place vowel if allowed
        if run_vowel + 1 <= K:
            cnt += 5 * dfs(pos + 1, run_vowel + 1)
        return cnt
    
    return dfs(0, 0)
```

## 4) Likely interview Q\&A

**Q1. Why is this DP valid?**
We partition by the **length of the trailing vowel run**. Any valid next character depends only on that run (append consonant resets to 0; append vowel increases by 1 but must be ≤ K). This gives optimal substructure and Markov-style transitions.

**Q2. Why use modulo `1e9+7`?**
The number of strings grows exponentially. Modulo keeps numbers bounded and is a standard prime for modular arithmetic.

**Q3. Time/Space complexity?**
Time `O(N*K)`; Space `O(K)` (rolling array).

**Q4. What if `K ≥ N`?**
Then any vowel run of length `> N` can’t occur, so the constraint is irrelevant: answer is simply `26^N (mod MOD)`. The DP also gives that result automatically.

**Q5. Can we do faster than `O(N*K)`?**
With tight constraints (`N ≤ 1000`) `O(N*K)` is expected. There are linear recurrences that allow matrix exponentiation for large `N`, but they’re overkill here and much harder to derive in an interview.

**Q6. How would you test edge cases?**

* `N=1, K=0` → 21
* `N=1, K≥1` → 26
* Large `N` with `K=0` → `21^N mod MOD`
* Large `N` with `K = N` → `26^N mod MOD`

# Transitions per step:

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few important ones)

* **Policy-constrained ID / token generation**
  Systems that generate human-readable IDs may forbid long vowel runs to avoid unintended words or to improve legibility.

* **Brand / product name exploration**
  When searching name candidates, you might restrict patterns (e.g., no more than K vowels in a row) to keep names pronounceable and diverse.

* **CAPTCHA & codewords**
  To reduce confusion (e.g., avoid “ooooo…” or “aeiou…” sequences), enforce a cap on consecutive vowels for better usability.

* **Combinatorics checks in linguistics / NLP**
  Estimating the size of a constrained search space of character sequences under simple phonotactic rules.
