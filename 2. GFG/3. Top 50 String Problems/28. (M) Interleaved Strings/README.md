## Problem

Given strings **s1**, **s2**, and **s3**, determine whether **s3** is formed by an **interleaving** of **s1** and **s2**.

**Interleaving** of two strings is a way to mix their characters to form a new string **s3**, **while maintaining the relative order** of characters from **s1** and **s2**.

### Conditions for interleaving

1. Characters from **s1** must appear in the same order in **s3** as they are in **s1**.
2. Characters from **s2** must appear in the same order in **s3** as they are in **s2**.
3. The length of **s3** must be equal to the combined length of **s1** and **s2**.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
`s1 = "AAB", s2 = "AAC", s3 = "AAAABC"`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** The string `"AAAABC"` has all characters of the other two strings and in the same order.

### Example 2

**Input:**
`s1 = "AB", s2 = "C", s3 = "ACB"`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** `s3` has all characters of `s1` and `s2` and retains the order of characters of `s1`.

### Example 3

**Input:**
`s1 = "YX", s2 = "X", s3 = "XXY"`
**Output:** `false`
**Explanation:** `"XXY"` is not interleaved of `"YX"` and `"X"`. The strings that can be formed are `"YXX"` and `"XYX"`.

---

## Constraints

* `1 ‚â§ s1.length, s2.length ‚â§ 300`
* `1 ‚â§ s3.length ‚â§ 600`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(n * m)`
  where `n = len(s1)` and `m = len(s2)`.

## 2) Concept + step-by-step dry run

### Problem in one line

Does `s3` come from weaving `s1` and `s2` **without changing** the relative order of characters in each?

### Key ideas

* If `len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3)`, it‚Äôs **impossible**.
* Let `i` = how many chars we took from `s1`, `j` = how many from `s2`.
  Then we must match `s3[i + j]` with **either** `s1[i]` or `s2[j]`.
* This is a classic 2D DP (or DFS+memo) over states `(i, j)`.

### Dry run (small but illustrative)

Input:

```
s1 = "AB"
s2 = "C"
s3 = "ACB"
```

Check lengths: `2 + 1 == 3` ‚úÖ

We‚Äôll fill a boolean DP where `dp[i][j]` = can we form `s3[:i+j]` using `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]`?

Initialize:

```
dp[0][0] = True       # empty + empty => empty
```

First row (only s2):

* `dp[0][1]`: does `s2[0] == s3[0]`?  `C` vs `A` ‚ùå ‚Üí `False`

First column (only s1):

* `dp[1][0]`: does `s1[0] == s3[0]`?  `A` vs `A` ‚úÖ and `dp[0][0]` is True ‚Üí `True`
* `dp[2][0]`: does `s1[1] == s3[1]`?  `B` vs `C` ‚ùå ‚Üí `False`

Middle cells:

* `dp[1][1]` corresponds to `s3[2]='C'`? (actually index 1: `i+j-1`)

  * From top: `dp[0][1]` is False ‚Üí ignore.
  * From left: `dp[1][0]` is True and `s2[0]=='C'` matches `s3[1]=='C'` ‚Üí `dp[1][1]=True`.
* `dp[2][1]`: final cell for `i=2, j=1`

  * From top: `dp[1][1]` is True and `s1[1]=='B'` matches `s3[2]=='B'` ‚Üí `True`.

`dp[2][1] == True` ‚Üí **Yes, "ACB" is an interleaving of "AB" & "C".**

## 3) Optimized codes in Python (multiple ways)

### A) Brute force (DFS, exponential) ‚Äî *for explanation only*

```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1, s2, s3):
        # Length check first; prunes hopeless cases in O(1)
        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):
            return False

        # Try all possibilities: exponential in worst case (2^(n+m))
        def dfs(i, j):
            k = i + j
            if k == len(s3):              # used all chars in s3
                return i == len(s1) and j == len(s2)
            return ((i < len(s1) and s1[i] == s3[k] and dfs(i+1, j)) or
                    (j < len(s2) and s2[j] == s3[k] and dfs(i, j+1)))

        return dfs(0, 0)
```

* **Time:** worst-case `O(2^(n+m))`
* **Space:** recursion depth `O(n+m)`

### B) Top-down DP (DFS + memo) ‚Äî *most common interview solution*

```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1, s2, s3):
        # Quick length check: O(1)
        if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):
            return False

        from functools import lru_cache

        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def dfs(i, j):
            k = i + j
            if k == len(s3):                      # reached end
                return i == len(s1) and j == len(s2)

            # Option 1: take next from s1 if it matches s3[k]
            if i < len(s1) and s1[i] == s3[k] and dfs(i+1, j):
                return True

            # Option 2: take next from s2 if it matches s3[k]
            if j < len(s2) and s2[j] == s3[k] and dfs(i, j+1):
                return True

            return False

        return dfs(0, 0)
```

* **Time:** `O(n*m)` (each `(i, j)` solved once)
* **Space:** `O(n*m)` for memo + recursion stack up to `O(n+m)`

### C) Bottom-up DP table ‚Äî clear & iterative

```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1, s2, s3):
        n1, n2, n3 = len(s1), len(s2), len(s3)
        if n1 + n2 != n3:
            return False

        # dp[i][j] => s3[:i+j] can be formed by s1[:i] & s2[:j]
        dp = [[False] * (n2 + 1) for _ in range(n1 + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = True

        # Only s1 contributes
        for i in range(1, n1 + 1):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] and (s1[i-1] == s3[i-1])

        # Only s2 contributes
        for j in range(1, n2 + 1):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] and (s2[j-1] == s3[j-1])

        # Fill the grid
        for i in range(1, n1 + 1):
            for j in range(1, n2 + 1):
                take_s1 = dp[i-1][j] and (s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1])
                take_s2 = dp[i][j-1] and (s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])
                dp[i][j] = take_s1 or take_s2

        return dp[n1][n2]
```

* **Time:** `O(n*m)`
* **Space:** `O(n*m)`

### D) Bottom-up with **1D space** (rolling array) ‚Äî optimal space

```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1, s2, s3):
        n1, n2, n3 = len(s1), len(s2), len(s3)
        if n1 + n2 != n3:
            return False

        # dp[j] corresponds to dp[i][j] in 2D
        dp = [False] * (n2 + 1)
        dp[0] = True

        # Row i = 0 (only s2)
        for j in range(1, n2 + 1):
            dp[j] = dp[j-1] and (s2[j-1] == s3[j-1])

        for i in range(1, n1 + 1):
            # Column j = 0 (only s1)
            dp[0] = dp[0] and (s1[i-1] == s3[i-1])
            for j in range(1, n2 + 1):
                take_s1 = dp[j]   and (s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1])  # dp[i-1][j]
                take_s2 = dp[j-1] and (s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])  # dp[i][j-1]
                dp[j] = take_s1 or take_s2

        return dp[n1]
```

* **Time:** `O(n*m)`
* **Space:** `O(m)` (or `O(min(n,m))` if you iterate over the shorter string as columns)

> üí° **Why memo/DP is needed:** Greedy ‚Äúalways match from s1 if possible else s2‚Äù fails with repeating letters (e.g., `s1="aa"`, `s2="ab"`, `s3="aaba"`).

---

## 4) Interview-style Q\&A

**Q1. Why is the length check necessary?**
If `len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3)`, we cannot possibly form `s3` by interleaving `s1` and `s2` ‚Üí early reject in `O(1)`.

**Q2. What‚Äôs the state definition in DP?**
`dp[i][j]` = ‚ÄúIs `s3[:i+j]` an interleaving of `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]`?‚Äù

**Q3. Transition / Recurrence?**
`dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]) or (dp[i][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])`.

**Q4. Time/Space complexity?**

* Top-down memo or bottom-up table: `O(n*m)` time, `O(n*m)` space.
* Space-optimized DP: `O(n*m)` time, `O(min(n,m))` space.

**Q5. Can we reconstruct the actual interleaving?**
Yes‚Äîstore parent pointers (or backtrack from `dp[n1][n2]`) to learn which choice (s1/s2) you took at each `(i, j)`.

**Q6. Why does a simple two-pointer / greedy approach fail?**
When both `s1[i]` and `s2[j]` match `s3[i+j]`, a greedy single choice can lead to dead-ends; DP explores both with memoization.

**Q7. Any edge cases?**

* Empty `s1` or `s2`.
* Repeated characters.
* `s3` starting with a long run of the same char as either `s1` or `s2`.
* Very unbalanced lengths (use 1D DP to save space).

**Q8. Can BFS be used?**
Yes: BFS over states `(i, j)` with visited set gives the same `O(n*m)` bounds, but DP is simpler and deterministic.

Below is a **complete, runnable Python program** that:

* Implements two solutions for **Interleaved Strings**:

  1. **Top-down DFS + memo** (clean & interview-friendly)
  2. **Bottom-up 1D DP** (same time, optimal space)
* Shows **time & space complexity** (inline comments at each step)
* Runs a few **sample inputs** and prints the **outputs** and **execution time** for each approach

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (why this pattern matters)

* **Stream merging**: Validate whether a log stream `s3` could be a merge of two sources `s1` and `s2` while preserving per-source order (important in distributed systems and event sourcing).
* **Parser/Protocol validation**: Check if a received sequence could be formed by interleaving two channel sequences without reordering within each channel.
* **Version control / CRDT intuition**: Determine if a final text could result from two ordered edit streams applied in some interleaved fashion (basic sanity checks for merge strategies).
* **Audio/Video multiplexing**: Validate frame/sample ordering constraints when combining multiple tracks while maintaining their internal order.
