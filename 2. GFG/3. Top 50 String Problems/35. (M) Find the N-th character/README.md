# Find the N-th character

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Accuracy:** 19.13%
**Submissions:** 67K+
**Points:** 4

Given a binary string `s`. Perform `r` iterations on string `s`, where in each iteration **0 becomes 01** and **1 becomes 10**.
Find the **n-th character** (considering **0-based indexing**) of the string after performing these `r` iterations (see examples for better understanding).

---

## Example 1

**Input:**

```
s = "1100"
r = 2
n = 3
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

**Explanation:**
After 1st iteration `s` becomes `"10100101"`.
After 2nd iteration `s` becomes `"1001100101100110"`.
Now, we can clearly see that the character at 3rd index is `1`, and so the output.

---

## Example 2

**Input:**

```
s = "1010"
r = 1
n = 2
```

**Output:**

```
0
```

**Explanation:**
After 1st iteration `s` becomes `"10011001"`.
Now, we can clearly see that the character at 2nd index is `0`, and so the output.

## Your task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **`nthCharacter()`** which takes the string `s` and integers `r` and `n` as input parameters and returns the **n-th character** of the string after performing `r` operations on `s`.

## Expected Time Complexity

`O(r * |s|)`

## Expected Auxiliary Space

`O(|s|)`

---

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^3`
* `1 ≤ r ≤ 20`
* `0 ≤ n < |s|`

## 2) Intuition + step-by-step dry run

### Key idea

* Each original character expands *independently*.
* After one step:
  `0 -> 01`, `1 -> 10`  (the **right** half is the **flip** of the left half)
* After two steps:
  `0 -> 0110`, `1 -> 1001`
* After `r` steps, **one original character** produces a block of length `2^r`.
* The nth character comes from **one block**:
  `block_index = n // (2^r)` and `offset_in_block = n % (2^r)`.

Now, what’s the bit at `offset_in_block` when we start from a single `0`?
That sequence is the **Thue–Morse sequence**:
value at offset `k` is `popcount(k) % 2` (number of 1s in `k`’s binary).

For a block that started with `c` (`0` or `1`), the bit is:

```
c XOR (popcount(offset) % 2)
```

So the whole task reduces to:

1. Find which original character’s block contains index `n`.
2. XOR that char (as 0/1) with the parity of set bits of the offset.

### Dry run (from the prompt)

**s = "1100", r = 2, n = 3**

* Block size = `2^r = 4`
* `block_index = 3 // 4 = 0`  → comes from `s[0] = '1'`
* `offset = 3 % 4 = 3`
* `popcount(3) = 2` → parity `0`
* answer = `1 XOR 0 = 1`

Matches the example output.

Another quick check:

**s = "1010", r = 1, n = 2**

* Block size = `2`
* `block_index = 2 // 2 = 1` → `s[1] = '0'`
* `offset = 0` → `popcount(0) = 0`
* answer = `0 XOR 0 = 0` ✔️

## 3) Optimized Python solutions (both styles)

### A) Optimal O(1) time, O(1) space (mathematical / Thue–Morse)

```python
#User function Template for python3

class Solution:
    def nthCharacter(self, s, r, n):
        # Size of each expanded block produced by one original character
        block = 1 << r  # 2^r

        # Which original character's block contains the nth position?
        i = n // block
        off = n % block

        # Convert the original character to integer bit (0/1)
        bit = ord(s[i]) & 1  # '0'->0, '1'->1

        # Parity of set bits at 'off' is the Thue-Morse value
        flips = (off.bit_count() & 1)  # 1 if odd, else 0

        # XOR: original bit flips 'flips' times
        return str(bit ^ flips)
```

**Why this is correct:**
The substitution system generates Thue–Morse over each block. The nth position sits inside one block determined by integer division. The Thue–Morse value at the offset gives the number of flips to apply to the starting bit.

**Complexity:** `O(1)` time and space.

### B) Safe brute (only builds up to n+1 chars each round)

This is the version you might write first in an interview before optimizing.

```python
#User function Template for python3

class Solution:
    def nthCharacter(self, s, r, n):
        # Expand only until length exceeds n (no need to build the whole string)
        cur = s
        for _ in range(r):
            out = []
            for ch in cur:
                if ch == '0':
                    out.append('0'); 
                    if len(out) > n: break
                    out.append('1')
                else:  # ch == '1'
                    out.append('1'); 
                    if len(out) > n: break
                    out.append('0')
                if len(out) > n: break
            cur = "".join(out[:n+1])  # keep only prefix we need
            # Early exit: if we already have the nth character and further expansions
            # won't change the prefix length logic, continue until r is done.
        return cur[n]
```

**Complexity:** `O(min(n, |s|·2^r))` time, `O(n)` space.
Works well when `n` is small even if `r` is large.

## 4) Interviewer-style Q\&A

**Q1. Why can we avoid building the entire expanded string?**
**A.** After `r` steps, each original character expands to a block of size `2^r`. The `n`-th character lies in exactly one block, so we only need that block’s *starting bit* and the *offset*. The internal pattern is Thue–Morse, determined by the parity of set bits in the offset.

**Q2. What is the Thue–Morse connection here?**
**A.** The substitution `0→01, 1→10` generates the Thue–Morse word. The value at position `k` of a block starting with `0` is `popcount(k) mod 2`. For a block starting with `1`, it’s that value XOR 1.

**Q3. What if `r` is big—do we risk overflow with `2^r`?**
**A.** Here `r ≤ 20`, so `2^r ≤ 1,048,576`. It easily fits in Python integers. The O(1) solution is safe and fast.

**Q4. Can this be done recursively?**
**A.** Yes. At each level, check if `n` falls in the left or right half of the current block. The right half is the flipped version of the left. Recur for `r-1` with adjusted `n`. That recursion is equivalent to computing the parity of set bits in the offset—i.e., Thue–Morse.

**Q5. Edge cases to watch?**
**A.**

* `n` at block boundaries (0, `2^r`, `2*2^r`, …).
* Very small strings like `s="0"` or `s="1"`.
* `r=0` (no change, answer is `s[n]`).
* Large `n` but still inside total expanded length (`block * len(s)`).

Absolutely—here’s a single, copy-pasteable Python program that:

* Implements the **O(1)** Thue–Morse solution for `nthCharacter`
* (Optionally) includes a **capped brute** for sanity checks
* Prints inputs & outputs for sample cases
* Times the optimal solution using `timeit`
* Annotates time & space complexity at each important step

"""
Problem: Find the n-th character after r iterations of the substitution:
         0 -> 01 , 1 -> 10  (0-based indexing)

Key insight (O(1) solution):
- After r steps, each original char expands to a block of length 2^r.
- n belongs to the block of index  n // (2^r).
- Inside that block, the value equals:
    original_bit XOR parity(popcount(offset)),
  where offset = n % (2^r), and parity(popcount(k)) is the Thue–Morse value.

Complexities:
- Precompute block size 2^r:            Time O(1), Space O(1)
- Index math (//, %, bit_count):        Time O(1), Space O(1)
- Overall function call:                Time O(1), Space O(1)

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (concise + important)

1. **L-systems / procedural generation**
   Grammar-like rewrites (e.g., plant growth models) often use exactly this kind of rule expansion; computing a specific symbol at a far position without expanding the whole string is critical.

2. **Data preview for grammar-compressed data**
   When data is stored via substitution rules, answering “what’s at index n?” quickly is essential for random access and streaming.

3. **Cellular automata & substitution tilings**
   Many CA/tiling systems produce Thue–Morse–like parity patterns. Efficient probing helps in simulation and visualization without blowing up memory.

4. **Testing & fuzzing generators**
   You can generate deterministic, pseudo-random-looking bits cheaply (Thue–Morse parity) for repeatable test inputs.
