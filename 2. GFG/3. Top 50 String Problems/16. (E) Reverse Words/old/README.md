## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, reverse the string **without reversing its individual words**. Words are separated by spaces.

> üìù **Note**:
> The string may contain leading or trailing spaces, or multiple spaces between two words.
> The returned string should only have a **single space separating the words**, and **no extra spaces** should be included.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input**:
`s = " i like this program very much "`
**Output**:
`"much very program this like i"`
**Explanation**:
After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string (not individual words), the input string becomes `"much very program this like i"`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input**:
`s = " pqr mno "`
**Output**:
`"mno pqr"`
**Explanation**:
After removing extra spaces and reversing the whole string, the input string becomes `"mno pqr"`.

---

### Example 3:

**Input**:
`s = " a "`
**Output**:
`"a"`
**Explanation**:
The input string contains only one word with extra spaces around it. After removing the extra spaces, the output is `"a"`.

---

## Constraints

* 1 ‚â§ `s.size()` ‚â§ 10‚Å∂
* String `s` contains only lowercase English alphabets and spaces.

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
* **Auxiliary Space**: O(n)

Sure! Here's a complete breakdown of the **"Reverse Words in a String"** problem, including a **text explanation**, **dry run**, **Python, C++, and JavaScript codes**, and **interview-style questions and answers**.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary

You are given a string `s` that may contain:

* Words separated by spaces.
* Leading or trailing spaces.
* Multiple spaces between words.

Your task is to:

* **Reverse the order of words**.
* Remove **extra spaces**.
* Keep **only a single space between words**.

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Explanation

**Approach:**

1. **Trim extra spaces** (leading, trailing, and between words).
2. **Split the string** into words using space as a separator.
3. **Reverse the list of words**.
4. **Join them** with a single space.

---

## üîç Dry Run

Input: `"  i  like   this program  very   much  "`

**Step 1: Trim and Split**
Split into: `["i", "like", "this", "program", "very", "much"]`

**Step 2: Reverse**
Reversed: `["much", "very", "program", "this", "like", "i"]`

**Step 3: Join**
Result: `"much very program this like i"`

## üë®‚Äçüíº Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is the time complexity of your solution?

**A:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each operation (trimming, splitting, reversing, and joining) takes linear time.

---

### Q2: How do you handle multiple spaces between words?

**A:** By using `split()` with regex in JS or `split()` in Python which ignores multiple spaces. In C++, we manually check for non-empty substrings.

---

### Q3: Why is trimming important in this problem?

**A:** To ensure there are no leading or trailing spaces in the final output and to avoid empty tokens.

---

### Q4: What is the auxiliary space used?

**A:** O(n), since we store the list of words separately before recombining.

---

### Q5: Can this be done in-place?

**A:** Yes, but it‚Äôs more complex. The in-place approach would require character-level swaps and careful word boundaries tracking‚Äîmore error-prone and used only if space is constrained.
