Given a string `s`, return the **length of the longest palindromic subsequence**.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A **palindromic** sequence is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

---

### Examples

**Input:** `s = "bbabcbcab"`
**Output:** `7`
**Explanation:** Subsequence `"babcbab"` is the longest subsequence which is also a palindrome.

---

**Input:** `s = "abcd"`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` and `"d"` are palindromic and all have a length `1`.

---

**Input:** `s = "agbdba"`
**Output:** `5`
**Explanation:** The longest palindromic subsequence is `"abdba"`, which has a length of `5`. The characters in this subsequence are taken from the original string `"agbdba"`, and they maintain the order of the string while forming a palindrome.

---

### Constraints

* `1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 1000`
* The string contains only lowercase letters.

---

### Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(n^2)`

Great choice—this is a classic DP problem that shows up a lot. Let’s make sure the idea sticks, then we’ll code a few interview-friendly solutions.

---

## 2) What’s being asked (and the key idea)

We want the **length** of the longest subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of a string `s` that reads the same forward and backward.

Two core viewpoints:

1. **Two-pointer on subsequences**
   Let `dp[i][j]` be the LPS length in `s[i..j]`.

   * If `s[i] == s[j]`: the ends can wrap a palindrome ⇒ `dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]`.
   * Else: best of dropping one end ⇒ `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

2. **LCS trick**
   LPS(s) = LCS(s, reverse(s)). This gives a clean O(n²) dynamic programming solution and a simple O(n) space optimization.

---

## 2) Step-by-step dry run (small example)

Let `s = "agbdba"` (answer should be 5 for `"abdba"`).

We’ll use the `dp[i][j]` definition (i ≤ j). Initialize length-1 palindromes:

* For all `i`, `dp[i][i] = 1`.

Consider substrings by increasing length `len = 2..n`.

* `len = 2`: check pairs

  * `"ag"` → different ⇒ `dp[0][1] = max(dp[1][1], dp[0][0]) = 1`
  * `"gb"` → different ⇒ `dp[1][2] = 1`
  * `"bd"` → different ⇒ `dp[2][3] = 1`
  * `"db"` → different ⇒ `dp[3][4] = 1`
  * `"ba"` → different ⇒ `dp[4][5] = 1`

* `len = 3`:

  * `"agb"`: `'a' != 'b'` ⇒ `max(dp[1][3], dp[0][2]) = max(1,1) = 1`
  * `"gbd"`: … ⇒ `1`
  * `"bdb"`: ends match ⇒ `2 + dp[3][3] = 3`
  * `"dba"`: … ⇒ `1`

* `len = 4`:

  * `"agbd"`: `'a' != 'd'` ⇒ `max(dp[1][4], dp[0][3]) = max(3,1) = 3`
  * `"gbdb"`: `'g' != 'b'` ⇒ `max(dp[2][5], dp[1][4]) = max(1,3) = 3`

* `len = 5`:

  * `"agbdb"`: `'a' != 'b'` ⇒ `max(dp[1][5], dp[0][4]) = max(3,3) = 3`

* `len = 6`: whole string `"agbdba"`: ends match `'a' == 'a'`
  ⇒ `dp[0][5] = 2 + dp[1][4] = 2 + 3 = 5`.

Answer is `5`.

## 3) Python solutions (interview-friendly)

### A) Top-down recursion + memo (clean logic; expected in whiteboard rounds)

* Time: O(n²) states, each O(1) ⇒ **O(n²)**
* Space: recursion depth O(n) + memo O(n²)

```python
#User function Template for python3

class Solution:

    def longestPalinSubseq(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        from functools import lru_cache

        @lru_cache(None)
        def solve(i, j):
            # base cases
            if i > j:        # empty range
                return 0
            if i == j:       # single char is a palindrome of length 1
                return 1

            if s[i] == s[j]:
                # use both ends
                return 2 + solve(i + 1, j - 1)
            else:
                # drop one end; take the better of the two
                return max(solve(i + 1, j), solve(i, j - 1))

        return solve(0, n - 1)
```

### B) Bottom-up DP on `dp[i][j]` (tabulation; very common)

* Time: **O(n²)**
* Space: **O(n²)**

```python
#User function Template for python3

class Solution:

    def longestPalinSubseq(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        # length 1 substrings are palindromes of length 1
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1

        # build by increasing substring length
        for length in range(2, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = 2 + (dp[i + 1][j - 1] if i + 1 <= j - 1 else 0)
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

        return dp[0][n - 1] if n else 0
```

### C) Space-optimized O(n) using the **LCS trick**

Compute LCS between `s` and `rev = s[::-1]`.

* Time: **O(n²)**
* Space: **O(n)**

```python
#User function Template for python3

class Solution:

    def longestPalinSubseq(self, s):
        # LPS(s) == LCS(s, reverse(s))
        t = s[::-1]
        n = len(s)

        prev = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            cur = [0] * (n + 1)
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                    cur[j] = prev[j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    cur[j] = max(prev[j], cur[j - 1])
            prev = cur  # roll the row
        return prev[n]
```

> **When to use which?**
>
> * If you need to reconstruct the subsequence, 2D `dp` (B) is convenient.
> * If memory is tight and you only need the length, (C) is perfect.
> * For clarity in interviews, (A) is often the cleanest to explain first, then mention tabulation and the LCS optimization.

---

## 4) Interviewer-style Q\&A

**Q1. Why does the recurrence work?**
A palindrome uses matching ends. If `s[i] == s[j]`, we can safely wrap the best inside `i+1..j-1`. Otherwise, the best palindrome in `i..j` must exclude one of the ends—take the max of the two options.

**Q2. What are time and space complexities?**

* Top-down memo or bottom-up tabulation: **O(n²)** time, **O(n²)** space
* LCS 1D optimization: **O(n²)** time, **O(n)** space

**Q3. Why does LPS equal LCS(s, reverse(s))?**
Any palindromic subsequence `p` in `s` appears in reverse order in `reverse(s)`, so `p` is a common subsequence between `s` and `reverse(s)`. The longest of those is the LPS.

**Q4. Can you reconstruct the subsequence, not just the length?**
Yes—store parent pointers while filling the 2D DP and backtrack to build the sequence.

**Q5. Edge cases to watch for?**

* Empty string (`""`) ⇒ answer 0
* All identical chars ⇒ answer `n`
* No repeating chars ⇒ answer 1

**Q6. Can we reduce space in the direct `dp[i][j]` (not LCS) approach?**
Yes—iterate `i` from right to left and keep one 1D array plus a `diag` temp to emulate `dp[i+1][j-1]`. But the LCS trick is simpler to implement and explain.

Here you go—an end-to-end, runnable program with clear inline complexity notes, example inputs/outputs, and a tiny timing harness using `timeit`. I included two common interview implementations so you can compare both speed and memory.

"""
Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)
-------------------------------------
Given a string s, return the length of the longest palindromic *subsequence*.

We provide two implementations:
  1) Bottom-up DP on s[i..j]  -> O(n^2) time, O(n^2) space
  2) LCS trick: LPS(s) = LCS(s, reverse(s)) with 1D DP -> O(n^2) time, O(n) space

We'll time both using timeit on a few example strings.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (why LPS matters)

* **DNA / RNA sequence analysis**
  Palindromic motifs are biologically meaningful (e.g., restriction sites). LPS logic helps in scoring or detecting palindromic tendencies within noisy sequences.

* **Error-resilient string similarity**
  LPS via LCS with reversed string can be used where palindromic structure matters in comparing strings (e.g., palindromic codes, mirrored data).

* **Text processing & compression heuristics**
  Long mirrorable subsequences can inform reversible transforms or hint at redundancy structures to exploit.

* **Computational linguistics / patterns**
  Detecting palindromic subsequences helps in stylometry or constraints inside generated text (poetry forms, puzzles).
