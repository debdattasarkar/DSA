Below is everything youâ€™d typically give in a neat interview solution set: a crisp explanation, a fully-worked dry run, multiple Python solutions in the requested format (with the right comments interviewers expect), and some quick Q\&A.

# 2) Problem explanation + step-by-step dry run

## What we need

Youâ€™re given two **non-negative integers as strings** `s1` and `s2`. Return their **sum as a string**.
Numbers can be up to `1e5` digits â†’ we **cannot** rely on native integer conversion (and in many interviewersâ€™ eyes, we shouldnâ€™t).

## Key idea (grade-school addition)

Add from the least significant digits (rightmost) to the left, keep a `carry`, and build the answer.

* Use two pointers `i = len(s1)-1`, `j = len(s2)-1`
* While `i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry`:

  * `d1 = int(s1[i]) if i>=0 else 0`
  * `d2 = int(s2[j]) if j>=0 else 0`
  * `total = d1 + d2 + carry`
  * Push `total % 10` to result
  * `carry = total // 10`
  * `i -= 1; j -= 1`
* Reverse the collected digits (or build from left using a deque)

Also strip *leading zeros in the final result* (unless the result is exactly `"0"`).

### Dry run: `s1 = "2500"`, `s2 = "23"`

```
i=3 (0), j=1 (3), carry=0 â†’ total=0+3+0=3 â†’ push '3' â†’ carry=0
i=2 (0), j=0 (2), carry=0 â†’ total=0+2=2 â†’ push '2' â†’ carry=0
i=1 (5), j=-1(0), carry=0 â†’ total=5+0=5 â†’ push '5' â†’ carry=0
i=0 (2), j=-1(0), carry=0 â†’ total=2+0=2 â†’ push '2' â†’ carry=0
i=-1, j=-1, carry=0 â†’ stop
Collected (reversed order): ['3','2','5','2'] â†’ reverse â†’ "2523"
```

### Edge cases to watch

* One of the strings is `"0"` or has leading zeros (e.g., `"000123"`).
* Carry remains after the last step (e.g., `"999" + "1" â†’ "1000"`).
* Very different lengths (e.g., `"1" + "99999"`).

# 3) Optimized Python codes (interview-friendly)

Both are linear `O(n)` time and `O(n)` extra space (for the output). The second variant avoids reversing a big list by using a deque.

## A) Two-pointers, collect then reverse (simple & clear)

```python
class Solution:
    def findSum(self, s1, s2):
        """
        Add two non-negative integers given as decimal strings.
        Time:  O(n) where n = max(len(s1), len(s2))
        Space: O(n) for the output string
        
        Logic:
        - Start from the right end of both strings, add digit by digit with carry.
        - Build digits in reverse order, then reverse once at the end.
        - Strip leading zeros from final result unless the entire result is '0'.
        """
        i, j = len(s1) - 1, len(s2) - 1
        carry = 0
        out = []  # collect digits in reverse

        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
            d1 = ord(s1[i]) - 48 if i >= 0 else 0  # faster than int(s1[i])
            d2 = ord(s2[j]) - 48 if j >= 0 else 0
            total = d1 + d2 + carry
            out.append(chr((total % 10) + 48))
            carry = total // 10
            i -= 1
            j -= 1

        # reverse to normal order
        res = "".join(reversed(out))

        # remove leading zeros, but keep at least one '0'
        # (input assures non-negative numbers; both can be "0...0")
        k = 0
        while k + 1 < len(res) and res[k] == '0':
            k += 1
        return res[k:]
```

## B) Two-pointers + deque (avoid reversing a huge list)

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def findSum(self, s1, s2):
        """
        Same logic as A but uses a deque to appendleft each digit,
        avoiding a full reverse at the end (good when strings are huge).
        Time:  O(n)
        Space: O(n)
        """
        i, j = len(s1) - 1, len(s2) - 1
        carry = 0
        dq = deque()

        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
            d1 = ord(s1[i]) - 48 if i >= 0 else 0
            d2 = ord(s2[j]) - 48 if j >= 0 else 0
            total = d1 + d2 + carry
            dq.appendleft(chr((total % 10) + 48))
            carry = total // 10
            i -= 1
            j -= 1

        res = "".join(dq)

        # Strip leading zeros but keep one zero if all zeros
        k = 0
        while k + 1 < len(res) and res[k] == '0':
            k += 1
        return res[k:]
```

> Why not use Pythonâ€™s big integers (`str(int(s1) + int(s2))`)?
> With constraints up to `1e5` digits, converting to `int` is impractical/forbidden and undermines the intention of the problem. Interviewers typically expect the manual addition approach.

# 4) Quick interviewer Q\&A

**Q1. Why canâ€™t we simply convert to integers and add?**
**A.** The strings can be up to `10^5` digits; conversion is memory/time heavy and often disallowed. The goal is to implement big-integer addition.

**Q2. Whatâ€™s the time and space complexity?**
**A.** `O(n)` time where `n = max(len(s1), len(s2))`, and `O(n)` extra space for the output.

**Q3. How do you handle leading zeros?**
**A.** We strip leading zeros from the **final** result (but keep a single zero if the sum is zero). Inputs may have leading zeros; thatâ€™s fineâ€”our addition logic naturally handles them.

**Q4. Any pitfalls?**
**A.** Donâ€™t forget:

* The leftover carry at the end.
* Using `or carry` in the loop.
* Extreme length differences (e.g., `"1"` + `"99999"`).

**Q5. Stable memory trick?**
**A.** Using a `deque` and `appendleft` avoids reversing a huge listâ€”useful when memory churn matters, though both are acceptable in interviews.

Awesome â€” hereâ€™s a complete, runnable script that:

* Implements the grade-school addition for string numbers
* Prints outputs for a few sample inputs
* Uses `timeit` to measure end-to-end runtime inline
* Includes clear inline comments with time/space complexity for each step

You can paste this into a file (e.g., `sum_strings.py`) and run it with Python 3.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few important ones)

1. **Financial/ledger systems**
   Money calculations for extremely large amounts with precise decimal digits (no floating-point) often store numbers as strings; big-integer addition is fundamental.

2. **Cryptography / arbitrary precision math**
   Implementations of large-number arithmetic (RSA, ECC tooling) rely on string/bignum operations when native types are insufficient.

3. **Data pipelines and ETL**
   When reading numeric fields that exceed standard integer limits from CSV/JSON logs, you may need to process them as strings while preserving exactness.

4. **Blockchain ledgers**
   Token balances and total supplies can exceed 64-bit integers. Summations are done in big-integer libraries that implement the same core idea as above.
