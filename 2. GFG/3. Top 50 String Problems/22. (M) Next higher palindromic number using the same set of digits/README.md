Given a palindromic number **N** in the form of string. The task is to find the **smallest palindromic number greater than N** using the **same set of digits** as in **N**.

---

## Example 1

**Input:**
N = `"35453"`

**Output:**
`53435`

**Explanation:**
Next higher palindromic number is `53435`.

---

## Example 2

**Input:**
N = `"33"`

**Output:**
`-1`

**Explanation:**
Next higher palindromic number does not exist.

---

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **`nextPalin()`** which takes the string **N** as input parameters and returns the answer, else if no such number exists returns **`"-1"`**.

---

## Expected Time Complexity

**O(|N| \* log|N|)**

## Expected Auxiliary Space

**O(1)**

---

## Constraints

* **1 ≤ |N| ≤ 10⁵**

Great problem—this one’s about finding the **next lexicographically larger palindrome** that uses **exactly the same digits** as the given palindromic string `N`.

Before we code, here’s the key idea you should internalize:

* A palindrome is completely determined by its **first half** (and the middle digit if the length is odd).
* To get the **smallest** palindrome that’s **greater** than `N` with the same digits, you only need to find the **next lexicographic permutation of the first half**. Then mirror it back to form the full palindrome.
* If the first half has **no next permutation** (it’s already the highest possible arrangement), then **no answer** exists → return `"-1"`.

---

## 2) Step-by-step explanation + dry run

### Algorithm (intuitive):

1. Let `n = len(N)`.
2. Extract the **left half**: `L = N[:n//2]`.

   * If `n` is odd, the **middle digit** is `mid = N[n//2]`.
3. Compute the **next permutation** of `L`.

   * If it doesn’t exist, return `-1`.
4. Build the palindrome: `L' + mid (if odd) + reversed(L')`.

   * This will be the next larger palindrome using the same digits.

### Why this works (in a sentence):

Only changing the left half (to the next lexicographic arrangement) and mirroring gives the **smallest possible** larger palindrome—any change to the right half must mirror a change in the left.

---

### Dry run 1

`N = "35453"` (length 5)

* `L = "35"`, `mid = "4"`.
* Next permutation of `"35"` → `"53"`.
* Form palindrome: `"53" + "4" + "35"` → `"53435"`.
  ✅ Output: `53435`.

### Dry run 2

`N = "33"` (length 2)

* `L = "3"`. A 1-char string has **no** next permutation.
  ❌ Return `-1`.

### Edge thoughts

* If zeros exist among digits, you still won’t get a leading zero in the next greater palindrome—because a leading zero would be **lexicographically smaller**, not larger.

## 3) Python solutions (brute for learning + optimal for interviews)

### A) Educational brute (only for tiny inputs; NOT for production)

> Generate **all permutations** of the first half, mirror each to a palindrome, filter those strictly greater than `N`, then take the minimum. This is `O((n/2)!)` – just to help you reason about correctness.

```python
# User function Template for python3
from itertools import permutations

class Solution:
    def nextPalin(self, N):
        n = len(N)
        if n <= 3:
            return "-1"  # there is no larger palindrome for length <= 3

        left = N[:n//2]
        mid = N[n//2] if n % 2 else ""

        seen = set()
        cands = []
        for p in permutations(left):
            if p[0] == '0':   # avoid leading zero palindromes
                continue
            if p in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(p)
            L = ''.join(p)
            pal = L + mid + L[::-1]
            if pal > N:
                cands.append(pal)

        return min(cands) if cands else "-1"
```

### B) Optimal solution (O(n)) — **next permutation of first half**

> Classic next-permutation steps:
>
> 1. Scan from right to left to find first index `i` with `a[i] < a[i+1]`.
> 2. Find rightmost `j > i` with `a[j] > a[i]`.
> 3. Swap `a[i], a[j]`.
> 4. Reverse suffix `a[i+1:]`.

```python
# User function Template for python3

class Solution:
    def nextPalin(self, N):
        n = len(N)
        # For length <= 3, it’s impossible to get a bigger palindrome with same digits
        if n <= 3:
            return "-1"

        # 1) Split into left, middle (if odd), and implicit right
        left = list(N[:n//2])
        mid = N[n//2] if n % 2 else ""

        # 2) Try to do next permutation on left half
        if not self._next_permutation(left):
            return "-1"  # left was already the highest arrangement

        # 3) Mirror back to form the palindrome
        L = ''.join(left)
        ans = L + mid + L[::-1]
        return ans

    def _next_permutation(self, a):
        """
        In-place next permutation for list of chars.
        Returns True if next permutation exists, else False.
        """
        # Step 1: find pivot i with a[i] < a[i+1]
        i = len(a) - 2
        while i >= 0 and a[i] >= a[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        if i < 0:
            return False  # no next permutation

        # Step 2: find rightmost j with a[j] > a[i]
        j = len(a) - 1
        while a[j] <= a[i]:
            j -= 1

        # Step 3: swap
        a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

        # Step 4: reverse the suffix
        l, r = i + 1, len(a) - 1
        while l < r:
            a[l], a[r] = a[r], a[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return True
```

**Why this is optimal:**
We touch each character a constant number of times → **O(n)** time and **O(1)** auxiliary space (ignoring the result string creation).

## 4) Interview Q\&A (rapid-fire)

**Q1. Why is it enough to next-permute only the first half?**
Because any palindrome is defined by its first half (and middle). The lexicographically next larger palindrome must minimally increase the left half; mirroring preserves palindromicity and minimality.

**Q2. What if the first half has no next permutation?**
Then the first half is already in descending order (maximum), so no larger palindrome with the same digits exists → return `-1`.

**Q3. How do you handle odd and even lengths?**
For odd length, keep the middle digit unchanged and mirror the updated left half. For even length, there’s no middle digit—just mirror.

**Q4. Time and space complexity?**
Time: **O(n)**; Space: **O(1)** auxiliary (we mutate/scan arrays; building the final string costs O(n), which is inevitable).

**Q5. Could this create a leading zero?**
No, because a leading zero would be lexicographically **smaller**, not larger. We only accept the **next** lexicographic configuration of the left half which yields a larger palindrome.

**Q6. How would you prove minimality?**
Among all palindromes greater than `N`, changing the left half to its **next** permutation is the smallest increase possible; mirroring ensures palindromicity and that the right half is consistent.

Awesome — let’s put everything together in a **single, runnable Python program** with clear, inline complexity notes and a tiny benchmark using `timeit`. After that, I’ll list a few high-value real-world uses.

```python

"""
Next higher palindromic number using the same set of digits.

Core idea:
- A palindrome is determined by its left half (and middle if odd length).
- Compute the next lexicographic permutation of the *left half* only.
- Mirror it to build the full palindrome. If no next permutation exists, answer is -1.

Overall Complexity:
- Time:  O(n)        (one pass to split + O(n) next-permutation + O(n) build)
- Space: O(1) aux    (we mutate a small list of size ~n/2 in place; output string costs O(n))

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (why this skill matters)

1. **Lexicographic ranking / next arrangement problems**

   * A lot of interview and competitive-programming tasks boil down to “next smallest/biggest arrangement under a constraint” — mastering **next permutation** and **mirroring** tricks is broadly useful.

2. **Symmetric code generation / palindromic identifiers**

   * Systems that generate symmetric IDs (for readability or checksum patterns) might need to iterate to the next valid symmetric value while keeping the same character multiset.

3. **Palindrome-aware search spaces**

   * In combinatorial search or cryptographic toy problems, constraining to palindromes cuts the search space in half. Efficiently moving to the *next* valid palindrome is an important primitive.
