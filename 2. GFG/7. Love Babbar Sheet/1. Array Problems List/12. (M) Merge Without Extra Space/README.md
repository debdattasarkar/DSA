## 📝 Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays `a[]` and `b[]` of size **n** and **m** respectively,
the task is to merge them **in sorted order without using any extra space**.

You must modify:

* `a[]` so that it contains the **first n smallest elements**, and
* `b[]` so that it contains the **last m elements**.

---

## 🔍 Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
a[] = [2, 4, 7, 10]
b[] = [2, 3]
```

**Output:**

```
a[] = [2, 2, 3, 4]
b[] = [7, 10]
```

**Explanation:**
After merging the two sorted arrays, we get `[2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10]`.
So the first 4 elements go to `a[]`, and the remaining 2 elements go to `b[]`.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
a[] = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20]
b[] = [2, 3, 8, 13]
```

**Output:**

```
a[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
b[] = [10, 13, 15, 20]
```

**Explanation:**
After merging, the sorted array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 20]`.
Now, `a[]` stores the first 6 elements and `b[]` the last 4 elements.

---

### Example 3

**Input:**

```
a[] = [0, 1]
b[] = [2, 3]
```

**Output:**

```
a[] = [0, 1]
b[] = [2, 3]
```

**Explanation:**
Both arrays are already in sorted order, so no modification is needed.

---

## ⚙️ Constraints

```
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 10^7
```

---

## ⏱️ Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** O((n + m) log(n + m)) or optimized O((n + m)) using Gap method
* **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## 💬 Summary

This problem is a **variation of the merge step in merge sort**, but you must do it *in-place* without using extra space like a temporary array.
Efficient approaches include:

* **Two-pointer method with swaps and re-sorting,**
* **Optimized Gap algorithm (Shell Sort idea).**

These techniques ensure that arrays remain sorted, and data is exchanged across arrays correctly without violating the O(1) space constraint.

Got it! Here’s the interview-ready breakdown for **Merge Two Sorted Arrays Without Extra Space**.

## 2) Intuition + step-by-step dry run

You’re given two **sorted** arrays `a` (size n) and `b` (size m). After merging in non-decreasing order, the **first n** elements must live in `a`, and the **last m** in `b` — using **O(1) extra space**.

### Why the classic “Gap” method works

Think of the two arrays as a single virtual array of length `N = n + m`.
Do a Shell-Sort-like pass with a **gap** (start with `ceil(N/2)`), compare elements that are `gap` apart, and **swap** when they’re out of order. Shrink the gap (`gap = ceil(gap/2)`) and repeat until `gap = 1` (final insertion-like sweep) then `0` (done). Because each pass reduces disorder at a decreasing stride, the whole combined sequence becomes sorted **in place**.

### Dry run (Gap method)

`a = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20]`, `b = [2, 3, 8, 13]`, `n=6`, `m=4`, `N=10`

* `gap = ceil(10/2) = 5`

  * Compare indices (i, i+gap) in the virtual array:
  * (0,5): a[0]=1 vs a[5]=20 → ok
  * (1,6): a[1]=5 vs b[0]=2 → **swap** → a=[1,2,9,10,15,20], b=[5,3,8,13]
  * (2,7): a[2]=9 vs b[1]=3 → **swap** → a=[1,2,3,10,15,20], b=[5,9,8,13]
  * (3,8): a[3]=10 vs b[2]=8 → **swap** → a=[1,2,3,8,15,20], b=[5,9,10,13]
  * (4,9): a[4]=15 vs b[3]=13 → **swap** → a=[1,2,3,8,13,20], b=[5,9,10,15]
* `gap = ceil(5/2) = 3`

  * Compare every pair (i, i+3); swap when needed.
  * After this pass: arrays become more ordered across the boundary.
* `gap = ceil(3/2) = 2`
* `gap = ceil(2/2) = 1` (final insertion-like sweep)

  * Final result: `a = [1,2,3,5,8,9]`, `b = [10,13,15,20]`.

The elements are globally sorted across both arrays, with no extra array used.

## 3) Python solutions (3 ways)

Use the method signature you asked for:

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeArrays(self, a, b):
        # code here
```

### A) ✅ Gap method (expected by interviewers) — O((n+m) log(n+m)) comps, O(1) space

```python
import math

class Solution:
    def mergeArrays(self, a, b):
        """
        Merge two sorted arrays a and b in-place using the 'Gap' method.
        Time  : O((n+m) * log(n+m)) comparisons (Shell-sort like gap sequence)
        Space : O(1)
        """
        n, m = len(a), len(b)

        def get(i):  # access virtual array [0..n+m-1]
            return a[i] if i < n else b[i - n]

        def set_(i, val):
            if i < n: a[i] = val
            else:     b[i - n] = val

        def swap(i, j):
            vi, vj = get(i), get(j)
            set_(i, vj)
            set_(j, vi)

        total = n + m
        if total <= 1:
            return a, b

        gap = math.ceil(total / 2)
        while gap > 0:
            i = 0
            while i + gap < total:
                # Compare elements at distance gap
                if get(i) > get(i + gap):
                    swap(i, i + gap)
                i += 1
            if gap == 1:
                break
            gap = math.ceil(gap / 2)
        return a, b
```

### B) Two-pointer + “insert into b” (simple idea, worst-case O(n·m), O(1) space)

At each `i` in `a`, if `a[i] > b[0]`, swap and then **insert** `b[0]` into its correct place inside `b` (shift like insertion sort). This keeps `b` sorted and pushes smallest values into `a`.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeArrays(self, a, b):
        """
        Time  : O(n * m) worst case (every swap may shift many elements in b)
        Space : O(1)
        """
        n, m = len(a), len(b)
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > b[0]:
                # Place a[i] into b and bring b's smallest to a[i]
                a[i], b[0] = b[0], a[i]

                # Restore sorting of b by inserting b[0] into proper position
                first = b[0]
                j = 1
                while j < m and b[j] < first:
                    b[j - 1] = b[j]
                    j += 1
                b[j - 1] = first
        return a, b
```

### C) Brute (not O(1) space) — concatenate & sort, then split

Good to mention as a baseline but **does not** meet the space constraint.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeArrays(self, a, b):
        """
        Brute force: create a merged list then copy back.
        Time  : O((n+m) log(n+m))
        Space : O(n+m)   <-- violates the O(1) extra space constraint
        """
        merged = sorted(a + b)
        n = len(a)
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = merged[i]
        for j in range(len(b)):
            b[j] = merged[n + j]
        return a, b
```

---

## 4) Interview quick-recall + likely Q&A

### 5-line pseudo-code (Gap method)

```
gap = ceil((n+m)/2)
while gap > 0:
    for i in 0..(n+m-gap-1):
        if V[i] > V[i+gap]: swap(V[i], V[i+gap])   # V is the virtual array across a and b
    gap = 1 if gap == 1 else ceil(gap/2)
```

**Mnemonic:** **“Gap → Compare → Swap → Shrink.”**

### What they may ask

* **Why does the gap method work?**
  It’s a Shell-sort style pass over the **virtual concatenation** of the arrays. Each pass moves elements closer to their final position; shrinking gap ensures final order with O(1) extra space.

* **Time & space complexity?**
  ~O((n+m) log(n+m)) comparisons; **O(1) extra space**.

* **Compare to two-pointer + insert approach?**
  Two-pointer + insert is simpler to reason but **O(n·m)** in worst case; gap is the standard **O(1)-space efficient** method interviewers expect.

* **Edge cases?**
  One or both arrays empty; all small elements in `b`; all big in `a`; duplicates; already merged order—gap handles all.

* **Can you do it in strict O(n+m)?**
  With O(1) space and arbitrary values, the theoretical clean O(n+m) in-place stable merge is non-trivial. The **gap** method is the practical/accepted approach.

### Tiny driver (optional)

If you want to test quickly:

```python
def run():
    tests = [
        ([2,4,7,10], [2,3]),
        ([1,5,9,10,15,20], [2,3,8,13]),
        ([0,1], [2,3]),
    ]
    sol = Solution()
    for a, b in tests:
        A, B = a[:], b[:]
        A, B = sol.mergeArrays(A, B)  # use gap version
        print(A, B)

# run()
```

---

### One sentence to say before you code

> “I’ll treat both arrays as a **single virtual array**, do Shell-sort-like passes with a **shrinking gap** and swap out-of-order pairs across the `a|b` boundary. That gives **O(1) space** and ~**O((n+m) log(n+m))** comparisons — the standard solution for this problem.”

# 🧩 Merge Two Sorted Arrays Without Extra Space

---

## 🚀 5. Real-World Use Cases

This is not just a coding trick — it has **practical data-engineering relevance**:

### 🔹 1. **In-memory Database Merging**

When merging two sorted index files (say B-tree leaf blocks) that must remain in-place without allocating large temporary arrays. This is how partial sort/merge operations are optimized in low-memory embedded systems.

### 🔹 2. **External Sorting (Disk-Based Merge Sort)**

During large-scale sorting (like Hadoop’s or Postgres’s merge phases), you may merge two sorted segments in memory-constrained environments — O(1) extra space is valuable for cache efficiency.

### 🔹 3. **Merging Sorted Logs or Time-Series Streams**

When multiple timestamped event logs are sorted individually but you need to unify them efficiently without reallocation — for example, merging IoT data from sensors where memory per device is limited.

### 🔹 4. **Low-Level System Optimization / Firmware**

Sorting and merging on microcontrollers or FPGAs where dynamic memory allocation is discouraged — gap-based or in-place merge ensures predictable memory footprint.
