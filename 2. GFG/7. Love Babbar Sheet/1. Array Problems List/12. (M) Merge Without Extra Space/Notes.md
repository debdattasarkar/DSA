Great question! The **gap method** you saw is directly inspired by **Shell sort**—so I’ll explain both, then tie them together for the *merge-without-extra-space* problem.

---

## 1) What is Shell Sort (the origin)?

**Shell sort** is an optimization over insertion sort.
Insertion sort moves elements one step at a time (gap = 1). Shell sort speeds this up by:

1. Starting with a **large gap** between compared elements (e.g., `n/2`),
2. Performing an **insertion-like pass** where you compare and swap elements that are `gap` apart,
3. **Shrinking the gap** (commonly halving/ceiling) and repeating,
4. Ending with **gap = 1**, which finishes the array quickly because it’s already “almost sorted.”

**Intuition:** When far-out-of-place elements exist, moving them many positions at once (large gap) is far more efficient than many adjacent swaps.

---

## 2) What is the “Gap Method” in this merge problem?

We have two *already sorted* arrays `a` and `b` and must merge them **in-place** (O(1) extra space).
Think of `a` and `b` as a single **virtual array** `V` of length `N = n + m`:

```
V[0..n-1]   = a[0..n-1]
V[n..n+m-1] = b[0..m-1]
```

We now **Shell-sort** this *virtual* array:

### Step-by-step procedure

1. **Initialize gap**
   `gap = ceil(N / 2)`.

2. **Sweep with current gap**
   For `i` from `0` to `N-gap-1`:

   * Compare `V[i]` and `V[i + gap]`.
   * If `V[i] > V[i + gap]`, **swap** them (across `a`/`b` as needed).
   * Move `i` forward by 1 and repeat.

3. **Shrink gap**
   If `gap == 1`, you’re done after this pass; else set `gap = ceil(gap / 2)` and go back to Step 2.

4. **Finish**
   When the loop ends, `V` is sorted, which means:

   * `a` holds the first `n` smallest elements,
   * `b` holds the last `m` elements.

**Key**: We *never* allocate a third array. We only swap in place, possibly swapping between `a` and `b`.

---

## 3) Why it works (the intuition)

* With **large gaps**, items that are far from their final position can “jump” closer quickly.
* As `gap` shrinks, the structure becomes increasingly “locally sorted,” so the final `gap = 1` pass (like insertion sort) incurs very few moves.
* Because `a` and `b` start sorted individually, there isn’t much disorder—just across the **boundary**. The gap passes systematically fix cross-boundary inversions without extra space.

---

## 4) Visual index mapping (how we access `a`/`b` as V)

For a virtual index `idx` in `[0, N-1]`:

* If `idx < n` → it refers to `a[idx]`
* Else → it refers to `b[idx - n]`

So a comparison at distance `gap`:

```
compare get(i) with get(i+gap)
if out of order -> swap(i, i+gap)
```

The helper functions `get`, `set_`, and `swap` in your code do exactly this mapping.

---

## 5) Small concrete walkthrough

`a = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20]`, `b = [2, 3, 8, 13]` → `N = 10`

* **gap = ceil(10/2) = 5**

  * Compare pairs `(V0,V5)=(1,20)`, `(V1,V6)=(5,2)→swap`, `(V2,V7)=(9,3)→swap`, `(V3,V8)=(10,8)→swap`, `(V4,V9)=(15,13)→swap)`
    After this pass, many cross-boundary inversions are fixed.
* **gap = ceil(5/2) = 3** → keep comparing `V[i]` with `V[i+3]`, swapping if needed.
* **gap = ceil(3/2) = 2**
* **gap = ceil(2/2) = 1** (final, like insertion sort)
  Now the sequence is nearly sorted; this pass finishes it.

Result:
`a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]`, `b = [10, 13, 15, 20]`.

## 6) Complexity & properties

* **Space:** O(1) auxiliary — we only swap in place.
* **Time:** ~O((n+m) * log(n+m)) comparisons with the simple gap sequence `ceil(gap/2)` (not a tight bound; in practice it’s fast).
* **Stable?** No — simple swap-based Shell-like passes are not stable. (Stability is not required here.)

---

## 7) Common pitfalls & tips

* **Don’t use sqrt gap rules**; use `gap = ceil(gap / 2)` or `gap = (gap + 1) // 2`.
* **Be careful with index mapping** between `a` and `b`. Test thoroughly at the boundary (`i < n` vs `i >= n`).
* **Stop condition:** After finishing the pass with `gap == 1`, you’re done.
* **Duplicates:** The method handles them fine.
* **Already ordered across boundary?** You’ll exit quickly—few or no swaps.

## 8) Tiny pseudocode to memorize (gap variant)

```
gap = ceil((n+m)/2)
while gap > 0:
    for i in 0 .. (n+m-gap-1):
        if V[i] > V[i+gap]: swap(V[i], V[i+gap])  # V maps onto a & b
    if gap == 1: break
    gap = ceil(gap/2)
```

**Mnemonic:** **“Gap → Compare → Swap → Shrink.”**

Use that line to confidently explain the approach in interviews.

### TL;DR

* **Shell sort** = insertion sort with **shrinking gaps**, moving far-off elements quickly.
* **Gap method (here)** = apply that idea to the **virtual concatenation** of `a|b`, swapping across the boundary as needed, with **O(1)** extra space.
