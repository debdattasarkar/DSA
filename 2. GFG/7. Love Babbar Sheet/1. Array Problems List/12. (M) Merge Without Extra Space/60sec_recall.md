Excellent — this is exactly the kind of question an interviewer wants you to **recall instantly under pressure**.

Let’s build your **5-line pseudo-code template** + **easy mnemonic** for the **Merge Without Extra Space (Gap Method)** problem.

## 🧩 5-Line Pseudo-Code Template

```
gap = ceil((n + m) / 2)                     # Step 1: initialize gap
while gap > 0:                              # Step 2: repeat until gap = 0
    for i in range(0, n + m - gap):         # Step 3: compare every gap pair
        if V[i] > V[i + gap]: swap(V[i], V[i + gap])  # Step 4: swap if out of order
    gap = ceil(gap / 2) if gap > 1 else 0   # Step 5: shrink gap, stop at 0
```

🧠 Think of `V` as the **virtual concatenation** of arrays `a` and `b`.
(Use helper functions `get()` and `set()` to map indices between them.)

## 🧠 Easy Mnemonic — **“G-C-S-S”**

> **G**ap → **C**ompare → **S**wap → **S**hrink

You can say this in your head while recalling:

> “Start with a big **Gap**,
> **Compare** elements gap apart,
> **Swap** if they’re out of order,
> **Shrink** the gap, repeat.”

It’s **four logical words** that let you rebuild the algorithm from scratch in any language.

## ⚡ 60-Second Recall Before Interview

| Time       | Step               | What to Recall                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **0–10s**  | **Concept**        | "We’re merging two sorted arrays **in place** — use the **Gap Method** from Shell Sort."               |
| **10–25s** | **Setup**          | "Compute total length = n + m → initialize gap = ceil(total / 2)."                                     |
| **25–40s** | **Core Logic**     | "Compare all pairs (i, i+gap) → swap if V[i] > V[i+gap]."                                              |
| **40–50s** | **Shrink step**    | "gap = ceil(gap / 2) until gap = 1 → finish when 0."                                                   |
| **50–60s** | **Answer summary** | "O((n+m) log(n+m)) time, O(1) space, derived from Shell Sort → compares across both arrays virtually." |

## 💡 Short Interview Answer Example

> “I’ll treat both arrays as a **single virtual array** and apply a **Shell-sort-like Gap Method**.
> Start with a large gap (`ceil((n+m)/2)`), compare pairs `gap` apart across both arrays,
> swap if out of order, then shrink the gap (`gap = ceil(gap/2)`) until it becomes 1.
> This ensures global sorting with **O(1) space** and **O((n+m) log(n+m))** time.”

✅ **In 5 lines + 4 words (G-C-S-S)** you can rebuild the entire algorithm in *any* language (Python, C++, Java) within 30 seconds.
It’s the **fastest and most memory-friendly pattern** for “merge without extra space” questions in interviews.
