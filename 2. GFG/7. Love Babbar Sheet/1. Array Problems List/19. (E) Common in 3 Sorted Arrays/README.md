## üìò Problem Statement

Given three sorted arrays in **non-decreasing order**, print all **common elements** in non-decreasing order across these arrays.
If there are no such elements, return an empty array.
In this case, the output will be `-1`.

> **Note:**
> Can you handle duplicates **without using any additional Data Structure**?

---

## üí° Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
`arr1 = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80]`
`arr2 = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100]`
`arr3 = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]`

**Output:**
`[20, 80]`

**Explanation:**
`20` and `80` are the only common elements in `arr`, `brr`, and `crr`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**
`arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
`arr2 = [6, 7]`
`arr3 = [8, 9, 10]`

**Output:**
`[-1]`

**Explanation:**
There are no common elements in `arr`, `brr`, and `crr`.

---

### Example 3:

**Input:**
`arr1 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
`arr2 = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
`arr3 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]`

**Output:**
`[1, 2]`

**Explanation:**
We do not need to consider duplicates.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

```
1 <= arr1.size(), arr2.size(), arr3.size() <= 10^5
-10^5 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 10^5
```

awesome ‚Äî here‚Äôs an interview-ready pack for **‚ÄúCommon Elements in 3 Sorted Arrays‚Äù** with clear logic, dry run, and multiple Python solutions in your requested format.

# 2) Explanation + Step-by-Step Dry Run

## Problem in one line

Given **three non-decreasing arrays**, return **all distinct values** that appear in **all three**.
If none exist, return `[-1]`.

## Key idea (most expected in interviews)

Use **three pointers** (`i, j, k`) walking the arrays **once**.
At each step compare `arr1[i], arr2[j], arr3[k]`:

* If all three are **equal**, it‚Äôs a common element ‚Üí record it, then **advance all three** (and **skip duplicates** in each array).
* Else, **advance the pointer** that has the **smallest** value (to catch up to the others).
* Repeat until any pointer reaches its array‚Äôs end.

This is linear time in total lengths and **O(1)** extra space (ignoring output).

### Why skipping duplicates works

Arrays are sorted. Once you output value `x`, advancing over any repeated `x` in each array ensures you never output `x` again.

---

## Dry run (from the prompt)

`arr1 = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80]`
`arr2 = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100]`
`arr3 = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]`

Start: `i=j=k=0`
Result `R = []`

|  i | a1 |  j | a2 |  k | a3 | Min? | Action                                     |
| -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | :--: | :----------------------------------------- |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  6 |  0 |  3 |   1  | advance `i` (1 is smallest)                |
|  1 |  5 |  0 |  6 |  0 |  3 |   3  | advance `k` (3 is smallest)                |

|  2 | 10 |  1 |  7 |  2 | 15 |   7  | advance `j`                                |
|  2 | 10 |  2 | 20 |  2 | 15 |  10  | advance `i`                                |
|  3 | 20 |  2 | 20 |  2 | 15 |  15  | advance `k`                                |
|  3 | 20 |  2 | 20 |  3 | 20 |   ‚Äî  | **equal ‚áí add 20; skip dups; i=4,j=3,k=4** |
|  4 | 40 |  3 | 80 |  4 | 30 |  30  | advance `k`                                |
|  4 | 40 |  3 | 80 |  5 | 70 |  40  | advance `i`                                |
|  5 | 80 |  3 | 80 |  5 | 70 |  70  | advance `k`                                |
|  5 | 80 |  3 | 80 |  6 | 80 |   ‚Äî  | **equal ‚áí add 80; skip dups; i=6 (end)**   |

Result: `R = [20, 80]`

# 3) Python solutions (multiple ways)

## A) Three-Pointer (recommended/optimal) ‚Äî **O(n1+n2+n3) time, O(1) space**

```python
# User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def commonElements(self, arr1, arr2, arr3):
        """
        Return distinct elements common to all three sorted arrays.
        If none exist, return [-1].

        Time:  O(n1 + n2 + n3)  -> single pass with three pointers
        Space: O(1) extra       -> only indices and output list
        """
        n1, n2, n3 = len(arr1), len(arr2), len(arr3)
        i = j = k = 0
        answer = []

        # Walk the three arrays simultaneously
        while i < n1 and j < n2 and k < n3:
            a, b, c = arr1[i], arr2[j], arr3[k]

            # Case 1: common value found
            if a == b == c:

        return answer if answer else [-1]
```

## B) Hash/Set intersection (simple to explain) ‚Äî **O(n1+n2+n3) avg., O(n) space**

```python
class SolutionSet:
    def commonElements(self, arr1, arr2, arr3):
        """
        Uses sets for clarity (NOT the in-place DS-free variant).
        Time:  O(n1 + n2 + n3) on average
        Space: O(n1 + n2 + n3)
        """
        s1 = set(arr1)        # unique values from arr1
        s2 = set(arr2)        # unique values from arr2
        s3 = set(arr3)        # unique values from arr3
        common = sorted(s1 & s2 & s3)  # intersection, sorted
        return common if common else [-1]
```

**When to mention this:** as a quick alternative if the interviewer allows extra memory or when arrays may not be sorted.

---

## C) Binary Search approach (hybrid) ‚Äî **O(n1 log n2 + n1 log n3)**

Scan the **shortest** array and binary-search each value in the other two arrays. De-duplicate as you go.

```python
import bisect

class SolutionBinarySearch:
    def commonElements(self, arr1, arr2, arr3):
        """
        Iterate the smallest array; binary-search in the other two.
        Time:  O(m log n + m log p) where m is smallest length
        Space: O(1) extra
        """
        arrays = sorted([arr1, arr2, arr3], key=len)  # smallest first
        a, b, c = arrays

        result = []
        prev = None  # to avoid duplicates from 'a'

        for x in a:
            if x == prev:  # skip dup in the driver array
                continue
            prev = x

            # binary-search x in b and c
            j = bisect.bisect_left(b, x)
            k = bisect.bisect_left(c, x)
            found_in_b = j < len(b) and b[j] == x
            found_in_c = k < len(c) and c[k] == x

            if found_in_b and found_in_c:
                result.append(x)

        return result if result else [-1]
```

# 4) Interview ‚Äúfast recall‚Äù + expected Q&A

## 10-second memory hook

* **Mantra:** ‚Äú**Three pointers, advance the smallest; when equal, record & skip dups.**‚Äù
* **Pocket code:**
  `while i<‚Ä¶ and j<‚Ä¶ and k<‚Ä¶:`
  `if a==b==c: add; i++; j++; k++; (skip dups)`
  `else: advance min(a,b,c) (skip its dups)`

## Likely follow-ups & crisp answers

**Q1. Why does advancing the smallest pointer work?**
Because arrays are sorted. If `a < b` or `c`, `a` can never match `b` and `c` at current positions; only by moving `a` forward can it possibly meet them.

**Q2. How do you ensure distinct output without extra DS?**
Whenever you add a value `x`, **skip all repeats of `x`** in **each** array. Also, whenever you advance the smallest value, skip its duplicates before the next comparison.

**Q3. Complexity?**
Three-pointer: **O(n1+n2+n3)** time, **O(1)** extra space.
Set-based: **O(n)** time avg., **O(n)** space.
Binary-search hybrid: **O(m log n + m log p)** time, **O(1)** space.

**Q4. What if arrays are not sorted?**
Either **sort them first** (then use three-pointer) ‚Üí O(n log n), or use **hash sets** to intersect in O(n) expected time with extra space.

**Q5. Edge cases?**

* One or more arrays empty.
* Heavy duplicates (e.g., many repeated `1`s).
* No common elements ‚Üí return `[-1]`.
* All elements common (e.g., identical arrays).

**Q6. Can we generalize to K sorted arrays?**
Yes: extend the idea by keeping a pointer per array and advancing the **minimum** each time, or repeatedly intersect two arrays at a time.

# 5) Real-World Use Cases (short, interviewer-relatable)

* **Log/Telemetry Reconciliation across Systems**
  Find event IDs present in **all three** logs (e.g., client app, API gateway, DB write log) to isolate requests that fully traversed the stack.

* **Master Data Intersection**
  Identify customers/products that simultaneously exist in **CRM**, **Billing**, and **Support** systems for reliable cohort analyses.

* **Security/Access Audits**
  Compute users who appear in **HR roster**, **SSO directory**, and **privileged group** to validate least-privilege access.

* **ETL Data Quality Checks**
  Cross-verify keys present in **raw**, **staged**, and **modeled** tables to ensure pipeline completeness before downstream reporting.

These examples map cleanly to ‚Äúintersection of multiple sorted (or sort-able) lists.‚Äù

### What this program does

* Prints results for several **sample inputs** (including the problem‚Äôs examples) using all three approaches and shows whether they match the expected output.
* Generates larger random **sorted** arrays and measures runtimes with `timeit`, giving a practical feel for performance:

  * **Three-Pointer** is linear in total length and uses **O(1)** extra memory.
  * **Set-based** is often fast too but uses **extra memory**.
  * **Binary-Search** is useful when one array is **much smaller** than the others.
