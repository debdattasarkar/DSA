Excellent üëè ‚Äî you‚Äôve just touched one of the most elegant and powerful selection algorithms in computer science: **Median of Medians**, also called **BFPRT algorithm** (after its inventors ‚Äî *Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, Tarjan*, 1973).

Let‚Äôs break it down **step-by-step, intuitively**, so you‚Äôll **remember and explain it in interviews**.

---

# üß† What is ‚ÄúMedian of Medians‚Äù?

It‚Äôs a **pivot selection strategy** used in **Quickselect** (and Quicksort) that **guarantees O(n)** worst-case time complexity,
**not just average case**.

Typical Quickselect is **fast on average (O(n))**, but can degrade to **O(n¬≤)** if pivots are poor (e.g., always smallest or largest).
The **Median of Medians** method ensures that never happens ‚Äî by finding a **‚Äúgood enough pivot‚Äù deterministically**.

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è The Core Idea

> Instead of choosing a random pivot, find an *approximate median* that‚Äôs guaranteed to be near the true median.

This pivot ensures that after partitioning, **each side contains at least 30% of the elements**, giving you a guaranteed O(n) recurrence.

---

# üß© Step-by-Step Algorithm (BFPRT)

Let‚Äôs say you want the **k-th smallest element** from an array `A` of size `n`.

---

### **Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Divide into groups of 5**

* Split the array into **‚åàn/5‚åâ groups**, each with up to **5 elements**.
* Example:

  ```
  [9,4,7,3,8,  6,2,1,5,0,  11,14,10,13,12]  
  groups ‚Üí [9,4,7,3,8] [6,2,1,5,0] [11,14,10,13,12]
  ```

---

### **Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Find the median of each group**

* Sort each small group (constant work per group, since 5 elements ‚Üí O(1)).
* Pick their median:

  ```
  [7, 2, 11]
  ```

Now you have an array of **group medians**.

---

### **Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Recursively find the median of these medians**

* Call the algorithm **recursively** to find the **median of these medians**.
  This value will serve as your **pivot**.

  > That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúMedian of Medians.‚Äù

---

### **Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Partition the array around this pivot**

* Partition `A` into 3 parts:

  * `L = {x | x < pivot}`
  * `E = {x | x == pivot}`
  * `G = {x | x > pivot}`

---

### **Step 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Recurse on the correct side**

* If `k` lies within the left side, recurse on `L`.
* If `k` lies in the middle (equal block), return the pivot.
* If `k` lies on the right side, recurse on `G`.

---

# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity Intuition

### Why is it O(n) worst-case?

Let‚Äôs see how much you discard each time.

* Each group of 5 contributes **at least 3 elements** that are either ‚â§ pivot or ‚â• pivot.
* So, at least **30% of elements** are guaranteed to be less than or greater than the pivot.

That gives this recurrence:

```
T(n) ‚â§ T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n)
```

‚û°Ô∏è Solves to **O(n)** worst case (linear time).

# üìà Comparison to Randomized Quickselect

| Feature         | Randomized Quickselect   | BFPRT (Median of Medians)                |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Pivot choice    | Random                   | Deterministic median of medians          |
| Expected Time   | O(n)                     | O(n)                                     |
| Worst-case Time | O(n¬≤)                    | O(n) ‚úÖ                                   |
| Space           | O(1)                     | O(1)                                     |
| Practical Speed | Faster (lower constants) | Slightly slower (heavier constant)       |
| Use case        | General purpose          | Mission-critical / theoretical guarantee |

So ‚Äî in **practice**, Quickselect with random pivot is faster and used in libraries (like `nth_element` in C++).
But **BFPRT** is a **textbook reference** for **guaranteed O(n)** deterministic selection.

# üßÆ Example Walkthrough

Find the **7th smallest element** in:

```
A = [9, 4, 7, 3, 8, 6, 2, 1, 5, 0, 11, 14, 10, 13, 12]
```

### Step 1

Groups of 5:

```
[9,4,7,3,8] ‚Üí median 7  
[6,2,1,5,0] ‚Üí median 2  
[11,14,10,13,12] ‚Üí median 12
Medians = [7, 2, 12]
```

### Step 2

Median of medians = **7** (since sorted [2,7,12])

### Step 3

Partition around 7:

```
L = [4,3,6,2,1,5,0]
E = [7]
G = [9,8,11,14,10,13,12]
```

### Step 4

|L| = 7 ‚Üí The 7th smallest element is **the largest element of L** = 6.

‚úÖ **7th smallest = 6**

# üîç When to mention in interviews

‚úÖ **If asked:** ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between randomized and deterministic Quickselect?‚Äù

Say:

> ‚ÄúMedian of Medians (BFPRT) deterministically finds a good pivot using groups of 5.
> It guarantees O(n) worst-case time for selection, at the cost of larger constants.
> In practice, random pivot Quickselect is faster, but BFPRT is the theoretical guarantee.‚Äù

üéØ **In one line (for interviews):**

> ‚ÄúBFPRT (Median of Medians) is a deterministic pivot selection algorithm for Quickselect that guarantees O(n) worst-case time by recursively finding an approximate median via groups of 5.‚Äù

---

Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a clean, interview-ready solution to the **k-th smallest** problem using **BFPRT (Median of Medians)**‚Äîthe deterministic Quickselect that guarantees **O(n)** worst-case time.

---

## What BFPRT does (in 1 sentence)

It picks a **deterministic, ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù pivot** by taking **medians of small groups (size 5)**, then the **median of those medians**; this pivot guarantees you discard a constant fraction each step ‚áí **worst-case O(n)**.

print(Solution().kthSmallest_BFPRT(arr, 7))   # -> 6  (7th smallest)
```

---

## Why this works (quick intuition you can say in interviews)

* **Groups of 5** let you compute medians cheaply and give a **provably good pivot**: after partitioning, you discard at least a constant fraction (~30%) of the array each step.
* Recurrence: `T(n) ‚â§ T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n)` ‚áí **T(n) = O(n)** worst-case.
* We use **3-way partition** so duplicates collapse into one pass, and we can **return immediately** if `k` lands in the equal block.

---

## Cheat-sheet answers (expect these)

* **Q:** Why groups of **5**?
  **A:** Keeps constants small and guarantees enough elements on each side of the pivot; that‚Äôs what makes the recurrence linear.
* **Q:** How‚Äôs this different from randomized Quickselect?
  **A:** Randomized is **expected O(n)** but can be **O(n¬≤)** worst-case; BFPRT is **deterministic O(n)** worst-case (slower constants).
* **Q:** Space & stability?
  **A:** In-place **O(1)** auxiliary space (ignoring tiny temp groups); not stable (we swap).
