Excellent question — and it’s one interviewers **love** to see you understand intuitively.
Let’s build your “mental picture” of **Quickselect** step by step.

---

### 🧠 What Quickselect *means*

**Quickselect** is an algorithm to find the **k-th smallest** element in an unsorted array **without fully sorting it**.

It’s based on the same idea as **Quicksort**, but instead of sorting *everything*, it only keeps exploring the part of the array that could contain your answer.

So you’re “selecting” (not sorting) — hence the name **Quick + Select**.

---

### 🔍 The idea in 10 seconds

1. Pick a **pivot** (any random element).
2. **Partition** the array:

   * All numbers **smaller than pivot** go to the left.
   * All numbers **larger than pivot** go to the right.
3. Now look at the pivot’s position:

   * If it’s exactly the **k-th position**, you’re done!
   * If it’s **too early**, go right.
   * If it’s **too late**, go left.

You only explore **one side** — so it’s much faster than sorting everything.

---

### 🪄 Easy Example to Remember

Say you want the **3rd smallest** number in

```
arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
```

Let’s pick pivot = **7**

**Step 1: Partition around 7**

```
[4, 3, 7, 10, 20, 15]
```

Now 7 is in position **index 2** (3rd place in sorted order, since we start from index 0).

**Step 2: Check position**

* We’re looking for k = 3 → index 2.
* Pivot is already at index 2. ✅

🎯 **Answer = 7** (3rd smallest element)

---

### 🔁 Another case (so it sticks)

Find **4th smallest** in the same array.
Pick pivot = 4.

Partition around 4:

```
[3, 4, 10, 7, 20, 15]
```

Pivot 4 is now at index 1 (2nd position).

We’re looking for **index 3** → so we ignore left side `[3, 4]` and continue **only on right half** `[10, 7, 20, 15]`.

Now pick a new pivot (say 10), partition that subarray:

```
[7, 10, 20, 15]
```

Pivot 10 is at index 1 of subarray, which is global index 3 — bingo!

✅ 4th smallest = 10.

### 🧩 How to remember it

Think of **Quickselect** like **“Quicksort, but lazy”**:

> “Don’t sort the whole thing — just zoom in on the side that has the answer.”

Or even simpler:

> “It’s like playing *hot and cold* with the pivot until you land on the k-th position.”

Great question 👏 — this is one of the **most commonly asked** Quickselect/Quicksort follow-ups!
Let’s break down **Lomuto partition** clearly and visually in words.

---

## 🧩 What is Lomuto Partition?

**Lomuto Partition Scheme** is a simple method used in **Quicksort** and **Quickselect** to rearrange elements around a **pivot**.

### 💡 Idea:

Pick **one element as the pivot** (usually the **last element**),
then rearrange the array so that:

* all elements **smaller than pivot** come **before it**,
* all elements **greater than or equal to pivot** come **after it**.

At the end, the pivot is placed in its **final sorted position**.

---

### 🧮 Example

Let’s partition this array using **Lomuto partition**:

```
arr = [7, 2, 9, 4, 3]
pivot = 3  (last element)
```

We’ll keep a pointer `i` for the “boundary” of smaller elements.

| Step  | j (current element)                      | arr[j] < pivot? | Swap                                   | Array after step | i      |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Start | -                                        | -               | -                                      | [7, 2, 9, 4, 3]  | i = -1 |
| 1     | 7                                        | No              | -                                      | [7, 2, 9, 4, 3]  | i = -1 |
| 2     | 2                                        | Yes             | Swap arr[i+1] & arr[j] → arr[0]↔arr[1] | [2, 7, 9, 4, 3]  | i = 0  |
| 3     | 9                                        | No              | -                                      | [2, 7, 9, 4, 3]  | i = 0  |
| 4     | 4                                        | No              | -                                      | [2, 7, 9, 4, 3]  | i = 0  |
| End   | Swap pivot with arr[i+1] → arr[1]↔arr[4] | -               | [2, 3, 9, 4, 7]                        | Pivot at index 1 |        |

✅ Final array: `[2, 3, 9, 4, 7]`
Pivot (3) is at **index 1**,
so:

* left side → `[2]` (smaller)
* right side → `[9, 4, 7]` (larger)

### ⚙️ Algorithm (simple pseudocode)

```python
def lomuto_partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]         # choose last element
    i = low - 1               # boundary of smaller elements
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] < pivot:    # found smaller element
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]  # swap it left
    arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]  # place pivot
    return i + 1              # pivot index (its final position)
```

---

### ⏱️ Complexity

* **Time:** O(n) — every element checked once
* **Space:** O(1) — in-place rearrangement

---

### 🧠 Mnemonic to remember

> **“Lomuto loves the last element.”**
> (because it always chooses the **last** element as pivot)

| Pivot choice | Usually last element        | Usually first element           |
