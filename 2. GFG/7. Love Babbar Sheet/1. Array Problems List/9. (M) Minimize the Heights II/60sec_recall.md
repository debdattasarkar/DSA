**‚Äú60-second recall kit‚Äù** and **5-line pseudo-code skeleton** for the classic **Minimize the Heights II** (Greedy + Sorting) problem ‚Äî a problem that‚Äôs both **mathematically elegant** and **commonly asked** in interviews by Microsoft and Adobe.

## üß† 5-Line Pseudo-code Template (Universal)

```
function getMinDiff(arr, k):
    sort(arr)                                      # 1Ô∏è‚É£ sort heights
    ans = arr[n-1] - arr[0]                        # 2Ô∏è‚É£ initial difference
    for i from 1 to n-1:                           # 3Ô∏è‚É£ try each partition
        if arr[i] - k < 0: continue                # skip negatives
        small = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k)        # 4Ô∏è‚É£ new min
        big   = max(arr[i-1] + k, arr[n-1] - k)    # 5Ô∏è‚É£ new max
        ans = min(ans, big - small)
    return ans
```

‚úÖ That‚Äôs all ‚Äî you can literally rebuild this in **any language** in under **30 seconds**.

## üß© Mnemonic (to remember easily)

> **‚ÄúSort ‚Üí Split ‚Üí Skip ‚Üí Shrink.‚Äù**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sort** the array (so the order is predictable).
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Split** at every index `i` ‚Äî left `(+k)` and right `(-k)`.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Skip** invalid cases (no negatives allowed).
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Shrink** the difference by choosing new min/max.

Say it once before coding:

> ‚ÄúSort, Split, Skip, Shrink.‚Äù

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Intuitive Explanation

After sorting:

* If you **add `k`** to the first `i` towers and **subtract `k`** from the rest,
  you‚Äôre exploring every valid configuration of raises and lowers.
* The smallest height after modification can come from either:

  * the leftmost tower raised by `k`
  * or a tower on the right decreased by `k`.
* The largest height can come from:

  * the rightmost tower lowered by `k`
  * or a tower on the left increased by `k`.

You compute both, take their difference, and minimize it.

## ‚ö° Quick Example (dry run mentally)

```
arr = [1, 5, 8, 10], k = 2
Sorted ‚Üí [1, 5, 8, 10]
Initial ans = 10 - 1 = 9

i = 1 ‚Üí small = min(3, 3)=3, big=max(3,8)=8 ‚Üí diff=5
i = 2 ‚Üí small=min(3,6)=3, big=max(7,8)=8 ‚Üí diff=5
i = 3 ‚Üí small=min(3,8)=3, big=max(10,8)=10 ‚Üí diff=7

‚úÖ Minimum diff = 5
```

## üß† 60-Second Recall Before Interview

When interviewer says:

> ‚ÄúMinimize the difference between max and min heights by ¬±K.‚Äù

You instantly recall:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sort the array.**
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Initial diff = last - first.**
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Loop i = 1 ‚Üí n-1:**

* Skip negatives (`arr[i]-k < 0`).
* Compute `small` = min(first+k, arr[i]-k).
* Compute `big` = max(last-k, arr[i-1]+k).
* Minimize `ans`.
  4Ô∏è‚É£ **Return ans.**

**Time:** O(n log n) (sorting)
**Space:** O(1)

## üß© Quick ‚ÄúWhy It Works‚Äù for Interviewers

> ‚ÄúOnce sorted, the optimal configuration will always be a single split ‚Äî all elements before `i` increased by `k`, all elements after `i` decreased by `k`.
> Trying every split guarantees we find the smallest possible max-min difference.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Final 10-Second Recap

| Step | Action           | Purpose                | Mnemonic   |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | Sort array       | To apply uniform logic | **Sort**   |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | Initialize `ans` | Start with max spread  | **Start**  |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | Loop `i`         | Try each split         | **Split**  |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | Skip invalids    | Avoid negatives        | **Skip**   |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | Update min/max   | Shrink difference      | **Shrink** |

üí° **Mnemonic:** **‚ÄúSort, Start, Split, Skip, Shrink.‚Äù**

Say that rhythm once, and you‚Äôll recall the full solution instantly in interviews.
