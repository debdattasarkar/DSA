## üß† 5-Line Pseudo-code Template (Greedy ‚Äî most expected solution)

```
sort(arr)
ans = arr[n-1] - arr[0]
for i in 1..n-1:
    small = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k)
    big   = max(arr[i-1] + k, arr[n-1] - k)
    ans = min(ans, big - small)
return ans
```

That‚Äôs the **entire logic** in 6 short lines.
Every interviewer expects you to recall this shape ‚Äî it‚Äôs a standard pattern.

## üß© Mnemonic: **‚ÄúSort ‚Üí Split ‚Üí Shrink‚Äù**

| Step  | Keyword    | Meaning                                                |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **S** | **Sort**   | Sort towers ascending ‚Äî always the first move          |
| **S** | **Split**  | Choose a split index `i` (left gets +k, right gets -k) |
| **S** | **Shrink** | Compute new min & max; update smallest difference      |

So the **3 S‚Äôs = Sort ‚Üí Split ‚Üí Shrink**
Easy to chant before the interview. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## ‚öôÔ∏è 60-Second Recall Routine

üïê **0‚Äì10s:**
Recognize the pattern ‚Äî "Minimize range by adding/subtracting k".
Say aloud: ‚ÄúGreedy, must sort and try all cut points.‚Äù

üïê **10‚Äì30s:**
Write the **baseline difference**:

```
ans = arr[-1] - arr[0]
```

üïê **30‚Äì50s:**
Remember **split logic**:

```
small = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k)
big   = max(arr[i-1] + k, arr[-1] - k)
```

Then shrink:

```
ans = min(ans, big - small)
```

üïê **50‚Äì60s:**
Close with complexity:

> ‚ÄúTime O(n log n) from sort, Space O(1). Works even if heights become negative.‚Äù

---

## üîÅ Visual Mental Hook

Think of **mountain peaks** üèîÔ∏è:

* You **push up small hills** by +k,
* You **grind down tall peaks** by -k,
* You look for the **narrowest mountain range** left.

> Sort ‚Üí Push up left ‚Üí Push down right ‚Üí Check gap.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick recap you can say to interviewer

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sort the heights first.
> Then for each index `i`, treat everything before it as +k and after it as -k.
> Compute new min and max at boundaries, and keep the smallest difference.
> Time O(n log n), Space O(1).‚Äù
