## üìò Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` and a positive integer `k` denoting the heights of towers, you have to **modify the height of each tower** by **either increasing or decreasing** them by `k` ‚Äî but **only once**.

Find out the **minimum possible difference** between the height of the **shortest** and **tallest** towers after modification.

> **Note:** The modified height of the tower can be negative.

---

## üß© Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 10], k = 2
```

**Output:**

```
5
```

**Explanation:**
The array can be modified as:
`[3, 3, 6, 8]`
The difference between the largest and the smallest is `8 - 3 = 5`.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [3, 9, 12, 16, 20], k = 3
```

**Output:**

```
11
```

**Explanation:**
The array can be modified as:
`[6, 12, 9, 13, 17]`
The difference between the largest and the smallest is `17 - 6 = 11`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

```
1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10‚Å¥
1 ‚â§ number of towers ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
0 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10‚Åµ

# 2) Intuition + step-by-step dry run

## Problem (one line)

Given tower heights `arr[]` and an integer `k`, you may change **each** height **exactly once** by either `+k` or `-k`. Minimize `(max_height - min_height)` after all changes. (In this ‚ÄúI‚Äù version, heights may go **negative** ‚Äî that‚Äôs fine.)

## Key idea (greedy that‚Äôs expected)

1. **Sort** the array.
2. If you add `k` to some prefix and subtract `k` from the rest, the extreme values after changes must be among:

   * left extreme: `min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k)`
   * right extreme: `max(arr[i-1] + k, arr[-1] - k)`
     for some split index `i` (1‚Ä¶n-1).
3. Try every split; keep the best (smallest) difference.

Why this works: after sorting, pushing the small values **up** (`+k`) and large values **down** (`-k`) is the only way to shrink the span. Any optimal assignment can be represented by one cut index between the two groups.

### Dry run 1

`arr = [1, 5, 8, 10], k = 2` ‚Üí sorted already
Initial (no changes): `10 - 1 = 9`

Try splits:

* `i=1`:
  `small = min(1+2, 5-2) = min(3, 3) = 3`
  `big   = max(1+2, 10-2) = max(3, 8) = 8`
  diff = `8 - 3 = 5`  ‚Üê best so far

* `i=2`:
  `small = min(3, 8-2=6) = 3`
  `big   = max(5+2=7, 8) = 8`
  diff = `5` (same)

* `i=3`:
  `small = min(3, 10-2=8) = 3`
  `big   = max(8+2=10, 8) = 10`
  diff = `7`

Answer = **5**.

### Dry run 2

`arr = [3, 9, 12, 16, 20], k = 3`
Initial = `20 - 3 = 17`

Try `i=1..4` ‚Üí best diff becomes **11** (e.g., at `i=2`: `small=min(3+3, 12-3=9)=6`, `big=max(9+3=12, 20-3=17)=17`, diff `11`).

        # If k == 0, nothing changes
        if k == 0:
            return best_diff

        # Scan all cut positions
        smallest_after_raise = arr[0] + k       # candidate when left side is raised
        largest_after_lower  = arr[-1] - k      # candidate when right side is lowered

        for i in range(1, n):
            # Left segment [0..i-1] uses +k, Right segment [i..n-1] uses -k
            min_height = min(smallest_after_raise, arr[i] - k)
            max_height = max(arr[i-1] + k,       largest_after_lower)
            best_diff = min(best_diff, max_height - min_height)

        return best_diff
```

> Note: Unlike ‚ÄúHeights II‚Äù, **we don‚Äôt skip** cases where `arr[i] - k < 0` because the problem allows negative heights.

Try all `¬±k` assignments using bitmasks. Only for very small `n` (teaching/demo).

    def getMinDiff(self, arr, k):
        """
        Brute force: try every ¬±k assignment.
        Time  : O(2^n * n)  -> infeasible for large n, only educational
        Space : O(1) extra
        """
        n = len(arr)
        if n <= 1:
            return 0
        best = float('inf')

        # Bitmask from 0..(2^n - 1): bit j=1 means +k, 0 means -k
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            mn = float('inf'); mx = -float('inf')
            for j in range(n):
                val = arr[j] + (k if (mask >> j) & 1 else -k)
                if val < mn: mn = val
                if val > mx: mx = val
            best = min(best, mx - mn)
        return best

# 4) Interview quick-recall + Q&A

## 30-second mnemonic ‚Äî **‚ÄúSort ‚Üí Split ‚Üí Shrink‚Äù**

* **Sort** the heights.
* Move **left group up** (`+k`), **right group down** (`-k`).
* For every **Split** `i`, compute
  `min = min(arr[0]+k, arr[i]-k)` and `max = max(arr[i-1]+k, arr[-1]-k)`
  and **Shrink** the answer with `max - min`.

Say this out loud while coding:

> ‚ÄúSort, baseline, scan cut i=1..n-1, min from (first+K or arr[i]-K), max from (arr[i-1]+K or last-K). Keep best.‚Äù

## High-yield Q&A

**Q1. Why does the single split cover all possibilities?**
Because after sorting, to reduce the span we‚Äôll always **raise some prefix** and **lower the suffix**. Any interleaving assignment can be reordered without worsening extremes, so a single cut is sufficient.

**Q2. Complexity?**
`O(n log n)` for sorting; `O(n)` for scanning; `O(1)` extra space.

**Q3. What about negative heights?**
In **Heights I**, negative is **allowed** ‚Üí no need to skip `arr[i]-k < 0`.
In **Heights II**, negative is disallowed, so you **skip** those splits.

**Q4. Edge cases?**

* `n <= 1`: answer `0`.
* `k == 0`: answer `max - min` (no change).
* Duplicate heights: algorithm still valid.

**Q5. How is ‚ÄúI‚Äù different from ‚ÄúII‚Äù?**
Heights **II** requires **every** tower to be modified and **no negatives**, so you add a guard `if arr[i] - k < 0: continue`. Logic otherwise is the same.

Perfect‚Äîhere are (5) crisp, interview-friendly use cases, then a complete runnable Python program (with your requested signature, inline complexity notes, sample inputs/outputs, and timing via `perf_counter` + `timeit`).

---

## 5) Real-World Use Cases (easy to relate)

1. **Manufacturing tolerances:** Parts come in varying heights; you can machine each by ¬±k once. Choose directions to minimize tallest‚Äìshortest spread so parts fit together.

2. **Audio/Video normalization:** Per-track loudness/brightness can be raised or lowered by the same fixed gain k. Pick ¬±k per track to minimize perceived dynamic range variation.

3. **Network latencies normalization:** Each service‚Äôs latency can be optimized up/down by a fixed budget k (cache, QoS). Choose directions to minimize worst-case spread.

4. **Exam score moderation:** Apply ¬±k curve to each student once (policy constraint) to tighten score spread while preserving relative order as much as possible.

5. **Warehouse shelf leveling:** Every shelf can be shimmed up/down by k once; minimize max difference so robots handle fewer extreme lifts.
