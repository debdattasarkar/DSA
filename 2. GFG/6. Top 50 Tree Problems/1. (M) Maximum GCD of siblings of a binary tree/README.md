## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a 2D list that represents the nodes of a **Binary Tree** with `N` nodes, the task is to **find the maximum GCD** of the siblings of this tree **without actually constructing it**.

---

### 📝 Note

* If there are **no pairs of siblings** in the given tree, print `0`.
* If given that there’s an edge between `a` and `b` in the form `{a, b}`, then **a** is the **parent node**.

---

## 🧩 Examples

### Example 1:

#### **Input:**

```
N = 7
arr = {{4, 5}, {4, 2}, {2, 3}, {2, 1}, {3, 6}, {3, 12}}
```

#### **Output:**

```
6
```

#### **Explanation:**

For the above tree, the structure looks like this:

```
       4
      / \
     5   2
        / \
       3   1
      / \
     6  12
```

The maximum GCD among siblings is **6**, formed for the nodes **6** and **12**, which are the children of node **3**.

---

### Example 2:

#### **Input:**

```
N = 3
arr = {{1, 2}, {1, 4}}
```

#### **Output:**

```
2
```

#### **Explanation:**

For the above tree:

```
     1
    / \
   2   4
```

The maximum GCD among siblings is **2**, formed for the nodes **2** and **4**, which are children of node **1**.

---

## 🧭 Your Task

You don’t need to read input or print anything.
Your task is to complete the function:

```python
def maxBinTreeGCD(N, arr):
    # code here
```

which takes:

* an integer `N`
* a 2D list `arr` denoting the edges as input
  and returns **the maximum GCD of siblings** in the binary tree.

---

## ⏱️ Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(E * logE)`, where `E` = number of edges in the tree
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`

---

## ⚙️ Constraints

* ( 1 \leq N \leq 10^5 )
* There might be edges with **similar values**.

Here’s a crisp, interview-style write-up for **Maximum GCD of Siblings of a Binary Tree** with a dry-run and multiple Python solutions in the exact function signature you asked for.

---

## 2) Problem intuition + step-by-step dry run

**What’s being asked?**
You’re given directed edges of a *binary* tree in the form `{parent, child}` (2-tuple/list). For every parent, look at its children that are **siblings** (same parent). Compute `gcd(childA, childB)` for each sibling pair and return the **maximum** of those values. If no parent has ≥2 children, return `0`.

> Because it’s a **binary** tree, any parent can have at most **two** children. So for a parent with two children `a` and `b`, the sibling GCD is simply `gcd(a, b)`.

### Dry run on Example 1

```
N = 7
arr = [[4,5],[4,2],[2,3],[2,1],[3,6],[3,12]]
```

Group children by parent:

* Parent 4 → children [5, 2]
* Parent 2 → children [3, 1]
* Parent 3 → children [6, 12]

Now compute sibling GCDs:

* For parent 4: gcd(5, 2) = 1
* For parent 2: gcd(3, 1) = 1
* For parent 3: gcd(6, 12) = 6

Max over all parents = **6** → **Answer = 6**

### Dry run on Example 2

```
N = 3
arr = [[1,2],[1,4]]
```

Parent 1 → children [2, 4] → gcd(2, 4) = 2 → **Answer = 2**

If there was no parent with two children, we’d return **0**.

---

## 3) Python solutions (brute & optimal)

### A) Optimal & idiomatic (O(E)) — Hash map, at most 2 kids per parent

* Build a dictionary: `parent -> list_of_children`.
* For each parent with ≥2 children:

  * If exactly 2 children `a, b`: answer candidate = `gcd(a, b)`.
  * (Tree is binary, but in case of bad data with >2, take pairwise gcd max.)
* Track max.

```python
# User function Template for python3
from math import gcd
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxBinTreeGCD(self, arr, N):
        """
        Time  : O(E) ~ O(N) because we touch each edge once and at most compute a few gcds.
        Space : O(E) to store parent->children lists.
        """
        if not arr:
            return 0
        
        # 1) Build parent -> list of children
        children = defaultdict(list)
        for p, c in arr:
            children[p].append(c)
        
        # 2) For each parent, if >= 2 children, compute best sibling gcd
        ans = 0
        for p, kids in children.items():
            if len(kids) >= 2:
                # Normally, binary tree => len(kids) <= 2
                # Be robust if more appear: compute the best pairwise gcd.
                if len(kids) == 2:
                    ans = max(ans, gcd(kids[0], kids[1]))
                else:
                    # Robustness: best pairwise gcd among the children (rare if input breaks binary property)
                    # O(k^2) where k is tiny in practice.
                    k = len(kids)
                    for i in range(k):
                        for j in range(i + 1, k):
                            ans = max(ans, gcd(kids[i], kids[j]))
        return ans
```

### B) “Brute but clean” (O(E log E)) — sort children per parent first

Sorting isn’t needed for correctness, but it’s a common “safe pattern” in interviews when you want stable ordering or to stress simplicity. Complexity slightly worse because of sorting overhead (though here each parent has at most 2 children, so it’s effectively the same).

```python
from math import gcd
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxBinTreeGCD(self, arr, N):
        """
        Time  : O(E log E) in the general sense due to sorting buckets (here tiny),
                practically O(E) for binary tree data.
        Space : O(E)
        """
        buckets = defaultdict(list)
        for p, c in arr:
            buckets[p].append(c)
        
        ans = 0
        for p, kids in buckets.items():
            kids.sort()                         # not needed, but harmless
            if len(kids) >= 2:
                # Since binary, just take the best pair (here: the only pair if 2 children)
                if len(kids) == 2:
                    ans = max(ans, gcd(kids[0], kids[1]))
                else:
                    # Robust fallback
                    for i in range(len(kids)):
                        for j in range(i + 1, len(kids)):
                            ans = max(ans, gcd(kids[i], kids[j]))
        return ans
```

> **Why both?**
> A) is the expected, streamlined approach.
> B) shows you can structure things predictably (group → sort → process), which interviewers sometimes appreciate when discussing generalizations.

## 4) Likely Interview Q&A

**Q1. Why does a simple hash map (parent → children) suffice?**
**A.** We only need sibling pairs, which are exactly nodes sharing the same parent. No full tree reconstruction or traversal is required; grouping by parent gives us everything we need.

**Q2. What if a parent has more than two children in the input?**
**A.** The problem states **binary** tree, so there should be at most two. To be robust, we take the maximum gcd over *all pairs* of its children (code handles this case safely).

**Q3. What’s the time complexity?**
**A.** O(E), where E is the number of edges (≈ N−1). We iterate edges once and do O(1) gcd per sibling pair (or O(k²) if some parent has k>2 kids, which is not expected in a binary tree).

**Q4. Any edge cases?**
**A.**

* No parent with two children → return `0`.
* Duplicate edges or repeated child entries → usually not present, but if they are, the logic still works (just more entries in that parent’s list).
* Large values: `gcd` is fast (Euclid), so it’s fine.

**Q5. Why not build the whole tree and do BFS/DFS?**
**A.** Overkill. We only need sibling pairs; grouping by parent is minimal and optimal.

**Q6. Can the answer be the parent’s value?**
**A.** No. The problem defines *GCD of siblings*, i.e., gcd of **children values** that share a parent.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few important ones)

1. **Network reliability & redundancy checks**
   Grouping links by a common router/switch (parent) and measuring a strength metric (here, gcd is just a proxy) across sibling connections can indicate redundancy quality or compatibility.

2. **Organizational hierarchy analytics**
   In org trees, comparing numeric attributes of sibling nodes (e.g., budgets, capacities, scores) can reveal pairs with strong alignment or common divisors that matter for resource pooling/planning.

3. **Filesystem / process tree health metrics**
   For processes/files under the same parent, computing a pairwise metric (size, CPU usage, frequency) between siblings helps in balancing workloads or detecting anomalies.
