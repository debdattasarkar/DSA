## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, your task is to complete the function `convertToRoman` which prints the corresponding Roman number of `n`.
Various Roman symbols and their values are given below:

| Roman | Value |

| D     | 500   |
| M     | 1000  |

### Special Cases:

* 4 is represented as `IV`
* 9 is `IX`
* 40 is `XL`
* 90 is `XC`
* 400 is `CD`
* 900 is `CM`

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
n = 5
```

**Output:**

```
V
```

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
n = 3
```

**Output:**

```
III
```

---

## Your Task:

Complete the function `convertToRoman()` which takes an integer `N` as input parameter and returns the equivalent Roman numeral string.

---

## Constraints:

* $1 \leq n \leq 3999$

## ‚úÖ **1. Text Explanation + Step-by-Step Dry Run**

### **Problem: Convert an Integer to a Roman Numeral**

You're given an integer `n` (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 3999). Convert it into its Roman numeral equivalent. Roman numerals are written by combining the following symbols:

| Roman | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| M     | 1000  |
| CM    | 900   |
| D     | 500   |
| CD    | 400   |
| C     | 100   |
| XC    | 90    |
| L     | 50    |
| XL    | 40    |
| X     | 10    |
| IX    | 9     |
| V     | 5     |
| IV    | 4     |
| I     | 1     |

We use the largest possible symbol and reduce the number until it becomes zero.

### **Dry Run:**

Let‚Äôs dry-run the input:

```text
n = 58
```

* Start with n = 58
* M (1000) > 58 ‚Üí skip
* ...
* L (50) ‚â§ 58 ‚Üí result = "L", n = 58 - 50 = 8
* X (10) > 8 ‚Üí skip
* V (5) ‚â§ 8 ‚Üí result = "LV", n = 8 - 5 = 3
* I (1) ‚â§ 3 ‚Üí result = "LVI", n = 2
* I (1) ‚â§ 2 ‚Üí result = "LVII", n = 1
* I (1) ‚â§ 1 ‚Üí result = "LVIII", n = 0

‚úÖ Final Roman numeral: `LVIII`

## ‚úÖ **3. Interview Questions and Sample Answers**

---

### ‚ùì **Q1: Why do we use descending order for values?**

**Answer:**
To ensure we always pick the largest possible Roman symbol first. This matches the Roman numeral construction logic, which places larger values before smaller ones.

---

### ‚ùì **Q2: What‚Äôs the time complexity of this approach?**

**Answer:**
`O(1)` ‚Äî since the number of Roman symbols used is constant (based on max value 3999), the number of operations is bounded.

---

### ‚ùì **Q3: What are the edge cases to consider?**

**Answer:**

* Minimum value (n = 1) ‚Üí Output: I
* Maximum value (n = 3999) ‚Üí Output: MMMCMXCIX
* Numbers that involve subtractive notation like 4, 9, 40, etc.

---

### ‚ùì **Q4: Could we use a map/dictionary instead of arrays?**

**Answer:**
Yes, a dictionary can be used to map integer to Roman, but we need a way to preserve the descending order. That‚Äôs why arrays (or ordered map in C++) are often preferred for iteration.

---

```python

# Function to convert decimal to Roman Numerals
def to_roman(x):
    
    # array of values and symbols
    base = [1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 40, 50, 90, 100, 400, 500, 900, 1000]
    sym = ["I", "IV", "V", "IX", "X", "XL", "L", "XC", "C", "CD", "D", "CM", "M"]

    # to store result
    res = ""

    # Loop from the right side to find
    # the largest smaller base value
    i = len(base) - 1
    while x > 0:
        div = x // base[i]
        while div:
            res += sym[i]
            div -= 1
        # Repeat the process for remainder
        x %= base[i]
        i -= 1

    return res

x = 3549
print(to_roman(x))

```

Both the code I provided and the one you've shown are **correct** and produce **valid Roman numerals**, but they differ in style and efficiency. Let's compare them to determine **which is better in a real-world / interview context**.

## ‚úÖ **Your Code Analysis (`to_roman`)**

### Key Characteristics:

```python
base = [1, 4, 5, 9, ..., 1000]
sym  = ["I", "IV", "V", "IX", ..., "M"]
```

* Starts from **smallest value (1)** and goes to largest.
* For each base, it calculates how many times it fits into `x` (`div = x // base[i]`), and appends the symbol `div` times.
* Decreases `x` accordingly (`x %= base[i]`).
* Iterates **from largest to smallest** using `i = len(base) - 1` to 0.

---

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* **Concise and functional**.
* Easy to understand for small inputs.
* Shows usage of quotient (`div`) and remainder.

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Has **two nested loops**:

  * Outer `while x > 0`
  * Inner `while div` loop: appends `div` times ‚Üí up to O(n) for large values.
* Slightly **less efficient** due to multiple string concatenations inside nested loops (which can be slow in some languages).
* **Not the most intuitive** for interviewers expecting a greedy approach with subtraction and single-pass.

---

## ‚úÖ **My Code (Greedy Roman Builder)**

### Key Characteristics:

```python
# Descending order
val = [1000, 900, 500, ..., 1]
sym = ["M", "CM", "D", ..., "I"]

while n > 0:
    while n >= val[i]:
        roman += sym[i]
        n -= val[i]
```

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* **Greedy approach** ‚Äî choose the biggest Roman value that fits.
* Very **interview friendly**: follows a standard greedy pattern.
* Only **one nested loop**, but **fewer iterations** (it subtracts base\[i] and continues).
* Clear alignment between value and symbol.
* Easily translatable across Python, C++, JavaScript.

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Slightly longer but more structured.

## ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

| Criteria             | Your Code (`to_roman`) | My Code (Greedy)      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Clarity              | Medium                 | High                  |
| Efficiency           | Slightly less optimal  | Optimal (less concat) |
| Interview Preference | Medium                 | High                  |
| Time Complexity      | O(n)                   | O(1) (bounded ops)    |
| Readability          | Decent                 | High                  |

---

### üî• **Verdict: Use the Greedy Code (My Version) in Interviews**

* It's more **standard**, **efficient**, and **communicates understanding of greedy algorithms** ‚Äî which is often what interviewers are assessing.
* Your version is fine for scripts or teaching, but **mine is preferable in high-performance or interview settings**.
