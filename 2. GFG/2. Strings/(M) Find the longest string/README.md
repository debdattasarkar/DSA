# 🧠 Problem: Find the Longest String

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Accuracy:** 56.04%
**Submissions:** 29K+
**Points:** 4
**Average Time:** 30 minutes

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words[]`, find the **longest string** in `words[]` such that **every prefix** of it is also present in the array `words[]`.

> **Note:** If multiple strings have the same maximum length, return the **lexicographically smallest** one.

---

## 📌 Examples

### Example 1

```
Input:
words[] = ["p", "pr", "pro", "probl", "problem", "pros", "process", "processor"]

Output:
pros

Explanation:
"pros" is the longest word with all prefixes ("p", "pr", "pro", "pros") present in the array words[].
```

### Example 2

```
Input:
words[] = ["ab", "a", "abc", "abd"]

Output:
abc

Explanation:
Both "abc" and "abd" have all the prefixes in words[].
Since "abc" is lexicographically smaller than "abd", the output is "abc".
```

---

## 📚 Constraints

* $1 \leq \texttt{words.length()} \leq 10^3$
* $1 \leq \texttt{words[i].length} \leq 10^3$

---

## ⏱ Expected Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** $O(n \times \texttt{max(words[i].size())})$
* **Auxiliary Space:** $O(n \times \texttt{max(words[i].size())})$

## ✅ 2. Text Explanation + Step-by-Step Dry Run

**Goal:**
Find the **longest word** such that **all its prefixes** are also present in the list.
If there's a tie, return the **lexicographically smallest** word.

---

### 🧠 Intuition

* A word is **valid** only if all its **prefixes (from length 1 to len(word) - 1)** are present in the word list.
* We need to scan all words, check prefix validity, and track the "best" word by:

  * Length (prefer longer words)
  * Lexicographical order if tie

---

### 🔍 Dry Run

Input:

```python
words = ["p", "pr", "pro", "probl", "problem", "pros", "process", "processor"]
```

1. Create a **set** of all words → lookup is `O(1)`.
2. Sort words alphabetically → to handle lexicographical order in ties.
3. For each word, check all prefixes:

   * `"pros"` → prefixes: "p", "pr", "pro" → ✅ all present
   * `"process"` → prefix `"proc"` ❌ not present
4. Track best valid word by length → `"pros"` becomes the answer

Result: `"pros"`

## ✅ 3. Optimized Python Codes (Brute + Interview Friendly)

---

### ✅ Approach 1: **Brute Force with Prefix Check**

```python
class Solution():
    def longestString(self, words):
        # Convert to set for O(1) prefix lookups
        word_set = set(words)
        # Sort to ensure lexicographical order in case of tie
        words.sort()
        longest = ""

        for word in words:
            valid = True
            # Check all prefixes of word
            for i in range(1, len(word)):
                if word[:i] not in word_set:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                # Choose word if longer or lexicographically smaller
                if len(word) > len(longest):
                    longest = word
        return longest
```

---

### ✅ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time:** `O(N * L)`

  * Sorting: `O(N log N)`
  * Prefix check per word: `O(L)`
* **Space:** `O(N * L)` for the word set

---

### ✅ Approach 2: **Trie + BFS** (For interviewer who wants advanced structures)

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = defaultdict(TrieNode)
        self.end = False
        self.word = ""

class Solution():
    def longestString(self, words):
        root = TrieNode()

        # Build Trie
        for word in words:
            node = root
            for ch in word:
                node = node.children[ch]
            node.end = True
            node.word = word

        # BFS to explore longest valid word (all prefixes must be end=True)
        queue = deque([root])
        longest = ""

        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for ch in sorted(node.children.keys(), reverse=True):
                child = node.children[ch]
                if child.end:
                    queue.append(child)
                    if len(child.word) > len(longest) or (len(child.word) == len(longest) and child.word < longest):
                        longest = child.word
        return longest
```

## ✅ 4. Interviewer Questions & Expected Answers

---

### ❓ Q1: Why did you use a set?

**A:** To check if all prefixes exist in `O(1)` time. This speeds up the prefix validation.

---

### ❓ Q2: Why sort the array before checking?

**A:** Sorting helps ensure that we always pick the **lexicographically smallest** string when there are multiple longest strings.

---

### ❓ Q3: Can you optimize space if memory is tight?

**A:** Yes, by not storing the full set and instead doing binary search over sorted words for prefix lookups (slower though).

---

### ❓ Q4: What if prefixes must be case-insensitive?

**A:** Normalize all words using `.lower()` or `.upper()` before processing.

---

### ❓ Q5: How would you solve this using Trie?

**A:** Use a Trie where each node marks the end of a valid word. Do a BFS from the root, only following paths where all nodes so far are marked as word-end.
