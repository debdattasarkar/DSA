# ‚úÖ Segregate Even and Odd Numbers

---

### üìò Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]`, **segregate even and odd numbers** in-place. The final array should contain:

1. All even numbers first **in sorted order**
2. Then all odd numbers **in sorted order**

üìù **Note**: Modify the array **in-place** (do not return a new array).

---

### üß™ Examples

#### Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3]
Output: [8, 12, 34, 90, 3, 9, 45]
Explanation: Even numbers are 12, 34, 8, 90 ‚Üí sorted ‚Üí [8, 12, 34, 90]
             Odd numbers are 45, 9, 3 ‚Üí sorted ‚Üí [3, 9, 45]
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]
Explanation: Evens ‚Üí [0, 2, 4], Odds ‚Üí [1, 3]
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: arr = [10, 22, 4, 6]
Output: [4, 6, 10, 22]
Explanation: All are even ‚Üí sorted ‚Üí [4, 6, 10, 22]
```

## üìå Constraints

* $1 \leq \text{arr.size()} \leq 10^6$
* $0 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 10^5$

---

### ‚è± Expected Time Complexity: O(n log n)

### üíæ Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Input:

```python
arr = [12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3]
```

### Process:

1. Traverse and separate:

   * Even: \[12, 34, 8, 90]
   * Odd:  \[45, 9, 3]

2. Sort each:

   * Sorted even: \[8, 12, 34, 90]
   * Sorted odd:  \[3, 9, 45]

3. Merge back:

   * Final arr: \[8, 12, 34, 90, 3, 9, 45]

## ‚úÖ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def segregateEvenOdd(self, arr):
        # Separate evens and odds
        evens = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]
        odds = [x for x in arr if x % 2 != 0]

        # Sort both sublists
        evens.sort()
        odds.sort()

        # Overwrite original array in-place
        for i in range(len(evens)):
            arr[i] = evens[i]
        for i in range(len(odds)):
            arr[len(evens) + i] = odds[i]
```


Your implementation is **correct** and readable, but let‚Äôs break down whether it is **fully optimized**, especially in terms of **space and in-place requirements**, as expected by interviewers:

---

## ‚úÖ Your Code: Analysis

```python
class Solution:
    def segregateEvenOdd(self, arr):
        evens = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]
        odds = [x for x in arr if x % 2 != 0]

        evens.sort()
        odds.sort()

        for i in range(len(evens)):
            arr[i] = evens[i]
        for i in range(len(odds)):
            arr[len(evens) + i] = odds[i]
```

## üîç Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value          | Notes                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | **O(n log n)** | Due to `sort()` on evens/odds             |
| Space Complexity | **O(n)**       | Uses **extra space** for evens/odds lists |

---

## ‚ùó But the Problem Says:

> ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to return the array, **you have to modify it in-place.**‚Äù

So technically, your solution is **not in-place**, since it uses **extra memory** (i.e., `evens[]` and `odds[]`).

---

## ‚úÖ Optimized In-Place Approach (Space: O(1))

To meet the **in-place** requirement with sorting:

1. Partition evens and odds using two pointers or stable partition.
2. Sort the even segment and odd segment in-place.

Here‚Äôs a more optimized variant:

```python
class Solution:
    def segregateEvenOdd(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)

        # Step 1: Partition even and odd using extra indices
        i = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if arr[j] % 2 == 0:
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
                i += 1

        # Step 2: Sort even and odd parts separately in-place
        arr[:i] = sorted(arr[:i])
        arr[i:] = sorted(arr[i:])
```

---

## üî¨ Optimized Version: Time & Space

| Metric | Value                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Time   | O(n log n)                             |
| Space  | O(1) extra (modifies input directly) ‚úÖ |

‚úÖ **Now it's truly in-place**, satisfies the problem‚Äôs expectation, and still keeps sorting.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

* Your solution is **correct** but uses **extra space** ‚Üí not fully in line with the "in-place" constraint.
* Use the **partition + slice sort** strategy shown above for an **optimized in-place version** (preferred in interviews).

Would you like this version translated into C++/JS too?

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    void segregateEvenOdd(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> evens, odds;

        // Separate evens and odds
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) evens.push_back(num);
            else odds.push_back(num);
        }

        // Sort both
        sort(evens.begin(), evens.end());
        sort(odds.begin(), odds.end());

        // Merge into original
        int i = 0;
        for (int num : evens) arr[i++] = num;
        for (int num : odds) arr[i++] = num;
    }
};

## ‚úÖ JavaScript Code

```javascript
class Solution {
    segregateEvenOdd(arr) {
        // Separate evens and odds
        let evens = arr.filter(x => x % 2 === 0).sort((a, b) => a - b);
        let odds = arr.filter(x => x % 2 !== 0).sort((a, b) => a - b);

        // Overwrite original array
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            arr[i] = i < evens.length ? evens[i] : odds[i - evens.length];
        }
    }
}
```

## üí¨ Interview Questions & Answers

---

### üîπ Q1: Why is sorting required?

**A**:
The problem demands that evens and odds are **not only segregated**, but also **individually sorted**.

---

### üîπ Q2: What‚Äôs the time and space complexity?

**A**:

* **Time**: O(n log n) ‚Üí due to sorting
* **Space**: O(1) auxiliary (if modifying in-place and using fixed memory buffers)

---

### üîπ Q3: Can it be done in O(n) time?

**A**:
Not if sorting is required.
If **only segregation** was needed, it could be done in O(n) using two-pointer partitioning.

---

### üîπ Q4: What if array contains only even or only odd numbers?

**A**:
Both cases are valid. Sorting a single sub-array still works and leaves the rest unchanged.

---

### üîπ Q5: Can this scale to 10^6 elements?

**A**:
Yes. Sorting arrays of that size is feasible in modern systems and well-supported by `sort()` in Python/C++/JS.

---

### üîπ Q6: What edge cases should be tested?

* All evens: \[2, 4, 6] ‚Üí sorted
* All odds: \[3, 5, 1] ‚Üí sorted
* Single element: \[1]
* Already sorted input
* Alternating even and odd: \[1, 2, 3, 4]
