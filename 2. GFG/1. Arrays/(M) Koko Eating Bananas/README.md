## Problem Statement

Koko is given an array `arr[]`, where each element represents a pile of bananas. She has exactly `k` hours to eat all the bananas.

Each hour, Koko can choose **one pile** and eat up to `s` bananas from it.

* If the pile has **at least `s`** bananas, she eats exactly `s` bananas.
* If the pile has **fewer than `s`** bananas, she eats the **entire pile** in that hour.

**Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.**

---

## Goal

Find the **minimum value of `s`** (bananas per hour) such that Koko can finish **all the piles** within `k` hours.

---

## Example 1

```txt
Input:
arr[] = [5, 10, 3]
k = 4

Output:
5

Explanation:
- Koko eats 5 bananas per hour.
- Time for each pile = [1, 2, 1] hours = 4 hours.
```

---

## Example 2

```txt
Input:
arr[] = [5, 10, 15, 20]
k = 7

Output:
10

Explanation:
- Eating rate 10 bananas/hour gives time = [1, 1, 2, 2] = 6 hours ‚â§ 7.
- 9 would require 8 hours.
```

---

## Constraints

* `1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^5`
* `1 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10^6`
* `1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10^6`

---

## Expected Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n √ó log(max(arr\[i])))
* **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

Here is the **text explanation**, a **step-by-step dry run**, and complete solutions in **Python**, **C++**, and **JavaScript** using **binary search** to solve the **Koko Eating Bananas** problem.

---

## üîç Problem Summary

Koko can eat bananas from one pile per hour. If she eats `s` bananas per hour:

* If a pile has ‚â• `s`, she eats `s` bananas.
* If a pile has < `s`, she eats the entire pile.

We need to find the **minimum possible value of `s`** such that she can finish all banana piles in `‚â§ k` hours.

---

## üí° Approach (Binary Search on Answer)

* Search range: from `1` to `max(arr)`
* At each `mid = s`, compute **total hours** needed to eat all bananas.

  * Use `ceil(pile / s)` per pile (or `(pile + s - 1) // s` for integers).
* If hours ‚â§ `k`, try smaller `s`.
* Else, increase `s`.

---

## üßÆ Dry Run Example

### Input:

```python
arr = [5, 10, 3], k = 4
```

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Search range:** `lo = 1`, `hi = 10` (max(arr))
2. Try `mid = 5`

   * Hours = ‚åà5/5‚åâ + ‚åà10/5‚åâ + ‚åà3/5‚åâ = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   * Valid ‚áí try smaller ‚Üí `hi = 4`
3. Try `mid = 2`

   * Hours = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 > 4 ‚áí `lo = 3`
4. Try `mid = 3`

   * Hours = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 > 4 ‚áí `lo = 4`
5. Try `mid = 4`

   * Hours = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 > 4 ‚áí `lo = 5`

‚úÖ Found minimum `s = 5`
