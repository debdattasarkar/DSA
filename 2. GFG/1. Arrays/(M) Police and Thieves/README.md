## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]`, where each element contains either a **'P'** for policeman or a **'T'** for thief, find the **maximum number of thieves** that can be caught by the police.

**Rules:**

1. Each policeman can catch **only one** thief.
2. A policeman **cannot catch a thief** who is more than **k units** away from him.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input:
arr[] = ['P', 'T', 'T', 'P', 'T'], k = 1

Output:
2

Explanation:
- First policeman catches first thief
- Second policeman can catch either second or third thief
```

---

### Example 2:

```
Input:
arr[] = ['T', 'T', 'P', 'P', 'T', 'P'], k = 2

Output:
3

Explanation:
- Maximum 3 thieves can be caught.
```

---

## Constraints

* $1 \leq \text{arr.size()} \leq 10^5$
* $1 \leq k \leq 1000$
* arr\[i] = 'P' or 'T'

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Police and Thieves ‚Äì Detailed Explanation

### ‚ùì Problem Summary

Given an array of `'P'` and `'T'`, and an integer `k`, each policeman `'P'` can catch at most one thief `'T'` within distance `k` to the left or right. Find the **maximum number of thieves** that can be caught.

### ‚úÖ Rules:

* One police can catch only one thief.
* A thief can be caught **only if** within distance ‚â§ `k`.

---

### üîç Step-by-Step Dry Run

#### Input:

```
arr = ['T', 'T', 'P', 'P', 'T', 'P'], k = 2
```

#### Process:

1. Maintain two lists:

   * `police_positions = []`
   * `thief_positions = []`

2. Traverse the array and store indexes of `'P'` and `'T'`.

   ```
   thief_positions = [0, 1, 4]
   police_positions = [2, 3, 5]
   ```

3. Use two pointers `i`, `j` to iterate over `thief_positions` and `police_positions`.

   ```
   i = 0, j = 0
   |2 - 0| = 2 <= k => count = 1, i++, j++
   |3 - 1| = 2 <= k => count = 2, i++, j++
   |5 - 4| = 1 <= k => count = 3, i++, j++
   ```

‚úî Final Count: `3`

## üí° Interview Follow-up Questions (with Answers)

### Q1. What‚Äôs the time and space complexity?

**A:**

* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n) for storing positions of police and thieves.

---

### Q2. What would be a brute-force solution?

**A:**
Try every combination of police and thieves with nested loops and distance check ‚Üí O(n¬≤) time.

---

### Q3. What if all elements were `'T'` or all `'P'`?

**A:**
Edge case ‚Üí return `0`, since no pairs possible.

---

### Q4. How would you test this function in production?

**A:**

* Use randomized tests of varying sizes.
* Edge tests like no thieves, no police, `k=0`, or `k >= len(arr)`.

---

### Q5. Can this be done in-place?

**A:**
Yes, we can avoid extra lists and use queues or two-pointer walk during traversal.
