# Group Balls by Sequence

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Accuracy:** 48.46%
**Submissions:** 14K+
**Points:** 4

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]` of positive integers, where each element `arr[i]` represents the number written on the *i-th ball*, and a positive integer `k`.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange all the balls into groups such that:

* Each group contains exactly `k` balls.
* The numbers in each group are **consecutive integers**.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
`arr[] = [10, 1, 2, 11]`, `k = 2`
**Output:**
`true`
**Explanation:**
The hand can be rearranged as `[1, 2]`, `[10, 11]`.
There are two groups of size 2. Each group has 2 consecutive cards.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**
`arr[] = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`, `k = 2`
**Output:**
`false`
**Explanation:**
The hand cannot be rearranged into groups of 2, since there are 5 cards, and 5 cards cannot be divided into groups of 2.

---

## Constraints

* `1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10‚Å∂`
* `0 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`
* `1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10¬≥`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(n)`

## üß† Problem Summary

Given an array `arr[]` of positive integers and an integer `k`, determine if it's possible to group all elements such that:

* Each group has exactly `k` elements.
* The elements in each group are **consecutive integers**.

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Sort the array** ‚Äì because to form consecutive groups, sorted order helps in easy access.
2. **Use a frequency map** (or Counter) to keep track of how many of each number exist.
3. **For each number `num` in the sorted array**:

   * If its count is zero, skip it (already used in a group).
   * Otherwise, try to form a group starting at `num` of length `k`:

     * For each `num + i` where `i` in `[0, k-1]`, check if it exists in the map with sufficient count.
     * If not, return `False`.
     * Otherwise, decrement the count for those numbers.

## üî¢ Dry Run Example

**Input:** `arr = [1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]`, `k = 3`
**Sorted:** `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]`

### Pass 1: Start with 1

‚Üí Form group `[1,2,3]`
‚Üí Frequencies of 1,2,3 reduce.

### Pass 2: Next smallest = 2

‚Üí Form `[2,3,4]`
‚Üí Frequencies reduce.

### Pass 3: Next = 6

‚Üí Form `[6,7,8]`
‚Üí All frequencies used.

‚úÖ Return `True`

## üìò Expected Interview Questions

### Q1: Why do we need to sort the array?

**A:** Sorting allows us to check for consecutive group formations easily and maintain group order starting from the smallest unused element.

---

### Q2: What is the time complexity?

**A:**

* Sorting: O(n log n)
* Group formation: O(n)
  ‚Üí **Total:** `O(n log n)`

---

### Q3: Can this solution handle large arrays efficiently?

**A:** Yes. The use of a hash map (`Counter` / `Map`) for frequency ensures constant-time access, making it scalable to large input sizes.

---

### Q4: What edge cases should you test for?

* `arr = []` and `k = 1` ‚Üí invalid
* Array with all same numbers ‚Üí valid if divisible by `k`
* Arrays with random gaps ‚Üí invalid
* `k = 1` ‚Üí each element forms its own group

---

### Q5: What if duplicates exist?

**A:** Handled using frequency counts. Each group formation checks and decrements frequency, supporting duplicates properly.
