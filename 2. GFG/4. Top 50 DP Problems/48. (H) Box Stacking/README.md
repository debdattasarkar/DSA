You are given a set of some types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the *i*th box has height `height[i]`, width `width[i]`, and length `length[i]` respectively. You have to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the **dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger** than those of the 2-D base of the higher box. Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side functions as its base. It is also allowable to use multiple instances of the same type of box. Your task is to complete the function **`maxHeight`** which returns the height of the highest possible stack so formed.

**Note:** Base of the lower box should be strictly larger than that of the new box we're going to place. This is in terms of both length and width, not just in terms of area. So, two boxes with same base cannot be placed one over the other.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
`height[] = [4, 1, 4, 10], width[] = [6, 2, 5, 12], length[] = [7, 3, 6, 32]`
**Output:** `60`
**Explanation:**
One way of placing the boxes is as follows in the bottom-to-top manner (denoting the boxes in `(l, w, h)` manner):
`(12, 32, 10) → (10, 12, 32) → (6, 7, 4) → (5, 6, 4) → (4, 5, 6) → (2, 3, 1) → (1, 2, 3)`
Hence, the total height of this stack is `10 + 32 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 60`. No other combination of boxes produces a height greater than this.

### Example 2

**Input:**
`height[] = [1, 4, 3], width[] = [2, 5, 4], length[] = [3, 6, 1]`
**Output:** `15`
**Explanation:**
One way of placing the boxes is as follows in the bottom-to-top manner (denoting the boxes in `(l, w, h)` manner):
`(5, 6, 4) → (4, 5, 6) → (3, 4, 1) → (2, 3, 1) → (1, 2, 3)`
Hence, the total height of this stack is `4 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 15`. No other combination of boxes produces a height greater than this.

### Example 3

**Input:**
`height[] = [3], width[] = [2], length[] = [6]`
**Output:** `8`
**Explanation:**
One way of placing the boxes is as follows in the bottom-to-top manner (denoting the boxes in `(l, w, h)` manner):
`(6, 3, 2) → (3, 2, 6)`
Hence, the total height of this stack is `2 + 6 = 8`. No other combination of boxes produces a height greater than this.

awesome — let’s make **Box Stacking** (GFG-style) crisp and interview-ready.

---

# 2) Explanation (with a worked dry run)

**Problem.** We have `n` box types, box `i` has dimensions `(h[i], w[i], l[i])`.
You may rotate a box so **any** side is the height; the remaining two sides form the **base**.
You may use multiple instances of the same type. You can place box **A** on top of box **B** **only if** B’s base sides are **strictly larger** than A’s base sides **individually** (not just by area).
Return the **maximum possible stack height**.

## Key idea (most expected)

1. **Generate 3 rotations per box.**
   For each `(h, w, l)`, create:

   * height = `h`, base = `sorted([w,l], reverse=True)` → `(bL=max, bS=min)`
   * height = `w`, base = sorted of `[h,l]`
   * height = `l`, base = sorted of `[h,w]`
     Storing base as `(bL ≥ bS)` makes comparisons unambiguous.

2. **Sort** all rotations by **base area** (or lexicographically by `(bL, bS)`), **descending**.

3. **DP (LIS-style on 2D).**
   Let `rot[k] = (bL[k], bS[k], h[k])`.
   Define `dp[k] = max height of a stack with rotation k at the **top** (i.e., ending at k)`.
   Transition:

   ```
   dp[k] = h[k] + max(dp[j]) over j < k and (bL[j] > bL[k] and bS[j] > bS[k])
   ```

   Answer = `max(dp)`.

> Why this works: sorting by area puts “bigger bases” before “smaller bases”. Then it’s a longest-increasing-subsequence style DP with a **strict** 2D dominance check on base sides.

### Dry run (Example 1)

`height=[4,1,4,10], width=[6,2,5,12], length=[7,3,6,32]`.

All rotations (write as `(bL, bS, H)`), base sorted descending:

For `(4,6,7)` → rotations:

* H=4, base=(7,6)  → (7,6,4)
* H=6, base=(7,4)  → (7,4,6)
* H=7, base=(6,4)  → (6,4,7)

For `(1,2,3)`:

* (3,2,1), (3,1,2), (2,1,3)

For `(4,5,6)`:

* (6,5,4), (6,4,5), (5,4,6)

For `(10,12,32)`:

* (32,12,10), (32,10,12), (12,10,32)

Now sort by area (bL*bS) descending. A (partial) sorted order is:

```
(32,12,10), (32,10,12), (12,10,32),
(7,6,4), (7,4,6), (6,5,4), (6,4,5), (6,4,7), (5,4,6),
(3,2,1), (3,1,2), (2,1,3)
```

Run LIS-like DP:

* Start with each `dp[k] = H[k]`.
* For each `k` from left to right, look back at `j < k` with strictly larger bases and update.
* One optimal chain (bottom→top) is:

  ```
  (12,10,32) -> (10,12,32)  (depending on sorted order; any strictly decreasing base pair is fine)
  -> (7,6,4) -> (6,7,4) (use a compatible rotation) -> (5,6,4) -> (4,5,6) -> (2,3,1) -> (1,2,3)
  ```

  (The exact sequence in the editorial example sums heights `10 + 32 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 60`.)

Final `max(dp)` = **60**.

# 4) Common interviewer Q&A

**Q1. Why do we create 3 rotations per box?**
Because any dimension can serve as the height. The remaining two are the base; we normalize base as `(bL ≥ bS)` so we can compare two bases by `bL` and `bS`.

**Q2. Why sort by base area (or base sides) descending?**
It arranges candidates from “large base” to “small base”, so when we scan `i` and look back at `j < i`, any feasible `j` is a potential **lower** box. We still enforce **strict** checks `bL[j] > bL[i]` and `bS[j] > bS[i]`.

**Q3. Why strict inequalities on both base sides?**
The statement says the lower base must be strictly larger **in both dimensions**. Equal bases cannot be stacked.

**Q4. Complexity?**
We have at most `3n ≤ 300` rotations. The LIS-style DP does `O(m^2)` checks → **`O(n^2)`** time for original `n`, and **`O(n)`** memory for the DP array.

**Q5. “Multiple instances of the same type” — do we need to duplicate rotations?**
No. With strict base decrease you can’t place two identical rotations directly on one another anyway. The standard rotations list already captures all needed possibilities; unlimited count doesn’t change the optimal height under strict base rules.

**Q6. Can we reconstruct the actual stack?**
Yes—store predecessor indices when updating `dp[i]`. Backtrack from the index with maximum `dp[i]`.

**Q7. Pitfalls?**

* Forgetting to **sort the base pair** so comparisons are consistent.
* Checking only base **area** instead of both sides (area alone is insufficient).
* Allowing non-strict (`>=`) comparisons—violates the problem.

---

---

Here’s a clean, **runnable** Box Stacking package that:

* implements the **LIS-style DP** (the standard solution for interviews),
* reconstructs one optimal stack (so you can see the chosen rotations),
* prints **inputs & outputs**, and
* times the **entire run** using `timeit.default_timer`.

---

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Box Stacking — build the tallest possible stack.

Each box i has dimensions (h[i], w[i], l[i]). You may rotate a box so any side
is the height and the remaining two sides form the base. You can place box A on
top of box B only if BOTH base sides of B are STRICTLY larger than those of A.
Multiple instances allowed (but strict base rule means identical bases can't sit
directly together).

We solve it with the classic LIS-style DP over all rotations:

Steps (with complexity notes inline):
  1) Generate 3 rotations per box; normalize base as (bL >= bS).   Time: O(n). Space: O(n)
  2) Sort rotations by base area (and ties) descending.            Time: O((3n) log(3n)). Space: O(3n)
  3) DP: dp[i] = best height if rotation i is on TOP.
     Transition over j < i if base[j] > base[i] strictly.          Time: O((3n)^2). Space: O(3n)
  4) Reconstruct one optimal stack via parent pointers.             Time: O(3n).   Space: O(3n)

Overall:
  - Time:  O(n^2) with a small log factor for the sort (n ≤ 100 -> fast)
  - Space: O(n)

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (high-value)

* **Warehouse pallet stacking / container loading:** Decide orientation and ordering of boxes so taller stacks fit under height limits while maintaining stable bases.
* **Robotics & automation (pick-and-place):** Plan stacking sequences for robotic arms that must respect contact surface constraints (strict base dominance).
* **3D printing & fabrication packaging:** Orient printed parts in boxes to achieve best layering while obeying footprint constraints.
* **Retail shelving / display planning:** Arrange items with varying footprints so larger-footprint items support smaller ones, maximizing vertical utilization.
* **Shipping optimization:** For shipments with strict “no overhang” rules, compute feasible stacks that maximize vertical space while avoiding equal-footprint collisions.
