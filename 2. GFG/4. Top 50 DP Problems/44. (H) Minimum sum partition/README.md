Given an array **arr[]** containing **non-negative** integers, the task is to divide it into two sets **set1** and **set2** such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum and find the **minimum** difference.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `arr[] = [1, 6, 11, 5]`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:**
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
Hence, minimum difference is 1.

### Example 2

**Input:** `arr[] = [1, 4]`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:**
Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
Subset2 = {4}, sum of Subset2 = 4
Hence, minimum difference is 3.

### Example 3

**Input:** `arr[] = [1]`
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:**
Subset1 = {1}, sum of Subset1 = 1
Subset2 = {}, sum of Subset2 = 0
Hence, minimum difference is 1.

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ arr.size() * |sum of array elements| ≤ 10^5`
* `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * |sum of array elements|)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(n * |sum of array elements|)`

awesome — here’s the interview-ready breakdown.

# 2) Explanation + step-by-step dry run

**Goal.** Split `arr` into two subsets `set1` and `set2` to minimize
`|sum(set1) - sum(set2)|`. Let `S = sum(arr)`. If we pick a subset with sum `x`, the other subset has sum `S - x`, so the difference is:

```
diff(x) = |(S - x) - x| = |S - 2x|
```

Therefore we just need an `x` that’s **achievable** as a subset sum and is as close as possible to `S/2` (check `x ≤ S//2`).

So the core task is **subset-sum reachability**.

### DP idea (most expected)

Use DP to mark which sums are possible. Two popular ways:

* Boolean 1-D DP array of length `S+1` (classic).
* **Bitset trick (fast & clean in Python):** keep an integer `bits` whose bit `t` is 1 iff sum `t` is achievable. Start with `bits = 1` (sum 0). For each `a` do `bits |= bits << a`. At the end, scan `t = ⌊S/2⌋ … 0` and return `S - 2*t` for the first `t` whose bit is set.

### Dry run: `arr = [1, 6, 11, 5]`

* `S = 23`, target side ≤ `11`.
* Start: `bits = 1` (…0001)
* After `1`: `bits |= bits<<1` → sums `{0,1}`.
* After `6`: add +6 to existing → sums `{0,1,6,7}`.
* After `11`: add +11 → sums `{0,1,6,7,11,12,17,18}`.
* After `5`: add +5 → many, including `{… 11, 12, 16, 17, …}`.
* Scan down from 11: 11 is achievable ⇒ answer `S - 2*11 = 1`.

        """
        Bitset subset-sum DP.
        Time:  O(n * S / w)  (Python big-int shifts are efficient; in practice fast)

        """
        S = sum(arr)
        bits = 1  # bit 0 set => sum 0 achievable

            bits |= (bits << a)

        # Look for the achievable sum t closest to S//2 (scan downward)
        half = S // 2
        # Check bits from half down to 0; the first set bit minimizes |S-2t|
        for t in range(half, -1, -1):
            if (bits >> t) & 1:
                return S - 2 * t

        S = sum(arr)
        dp = [False] * (S + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        for a in arr:
            # reverse so each item is used at most once
            for s in range(S, a - 1, -1):
                if dp[s - a]:
                    dp[s] = True

            if dp[t]:
                return S - 2 * t

## C) Educational brute force (use only for tiny n) — **O(2^n)** time, **O(n)** space

```python
#User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, arr):
        """
        Backtracking over all subsets to compute reachable sums.

        def dfs(i, cur):
            nonlocal best
            if i == n:
                # only need sums up to S//2; mirror handles the rest
                if cur <= S // 2:
                    best = min(best, S - 2 * cur)
                return
            # choose arr[i]
            dfs(i + 1, cur + arr[i])
            # skip arr[i]
            dfs(i + 1, cur)

        dfs(0, 0)
        return best

# 4) Likely interviewer Q&A

**Q1. Why is it enough to search sums `≤ S/2`?**
Because `|S - 2x|` is symmetric around `S/2`. If `x > S/2`, the paired sum `S - x < S/2` yields the same difference.

**Q2. State/transition for the DP?**
`dp[s] = True` if sum `s` is achievable. For each `a` and for `s` from `S` down to `a`:
`dp[s] |= dp[s - a]`. Reverse order ensures each item is used once.

**Q3. Time/space complexity?**
Classic DP: `O(n·S)` time, `O(S)` space. Bitset uses the same conceptual space but is typically faster due to word-level operations.

**Q4. What if negatives are present?**
This problem assumes **non-negative** integers. With negatives, standard subset-sum DP and the bitset trick don’t apply directly; you’d need offsetting or different techniques.

**Q5. Can we reconstruct the two subsets?**
Yes. Keep parent pointers (or rerun a trace) from `dp` to recover which items contributed to the chosen `t`, then the rest go to the other subset.

**Q6. Any optimizations for large `S` but small `n`?**
Use **meet-in-the-middle**: split into halves, enumerate sums of each (O(2^{n/2})), sort one side, and two-pointer or binary search to find closest to `S/2`.

here’s a clean, runnable script that:

* implements the **Minimum Sum Partition** using the fastest Python-friendly **bitset DP** (plus a classic 1-D boolean DP variant),
* shows **inputs & outputs**, and
* times the **entire run** using `timeit.default_timer` (the same high-res clock `timeit` uses).

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (high-value)

* **Balanced load distribution:** Split tasks/resources across two servers or teams so total loads are as equal as possible (minimize imbalance).

* **Fair team/shift assignment:** Divide people by weights (skill points, seniority, hours) into two groups with minimal difference.

* **Budget or inventory split:** Allocate line items into two budgets/containers to keep totals close (e.g., two delivery trucks with similar total weight/value).

* **A/B test cohort balancing:** When you can’t split by features directly, approximate balance by minimizing total-score difference between two cohorts.
