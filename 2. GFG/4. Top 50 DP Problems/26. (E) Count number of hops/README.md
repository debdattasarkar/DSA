# Count number of hops — explanation, dry run, and interview-ready Python

## 2) Problem intuition & recurrence (step-by-step)

A frog can jump **1**, **2**, or **3** steps at a time.
Let `f(n)` be the number of ways to reach the `n`-th step.

* To land on step `n`, the last jump could be:

  * from `n-1` using a 1-step jump,
  * from `n-2` using a 2-step jump,
  * from `n-3` using a 3-step jump.

So every way to reach `n` is formed by appending that last jump to a valid way to reach `n-1`, `n-2`, or `n-3`.

**Recurrence**

```
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3)
Base: f(0) = 1 (empty way), f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2
```

This is the classic **Tribonacci** relation with those bases.

### Why `f(0) = 1`?

It represents “already at the ground step without moving.” It ensures counts line up when `n` is 1, 2, or 3.

---

## 2b) Dry runs

### Dry run for n = 4

We compute bottom-up:

* `f(0)=1`
* `f(1)=1`
* `f(2)=2` → (1+1, 2)

Now apply the recurrence:

* `f(3)=f(2)+f(1)+f(0)=2+1+1=4`

  * (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1, 3)
* `f(4)=f(3)+f(2)+f(1)=4+2+1=7`

Result: **7** ways (matches the sample list).

### Dry run for n = 5 (one more for confidence)

* Already have: `f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=7`
* `f(5)=f(4)+f(3)+f(2)=7+4+2=13`

## 3) Python solutions (brute → memoized → iterative O(1) space)

Below is the **interview-friendly template**.
Pick **one** implementation body; I provide three options in-place, with the **optimized O(1) space** version enabled by default.

```python
# User function Template for python3

class Solution:
    # Function to count the number of ways in which frog can reach the top.
    def countWays(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Returns the exact count (no modulo) for n up to 30.
        Recurrence: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3)
        Base: f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=2
        """

        # ---------- Option 3 (enabled): Iterative with O(1) space ----------
        # Rationale: Most expected in interviews — linear time, constant space.
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        # rolling variables for f(n-3), f(n-2), f(n-1)
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 2  # f(0), f(1), f(2)
        for _ in range(3, n + 1):
            a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c  # shift window and compute next tribonacci
        return c

        # ---------- Option 2: DP with memoization (Top-Down) ----------
        # Uncomment to use.
        # from functools import lru_cache
        #
        # @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        # def solve(k: int) -> int:
        #     if k == 0: return 1
        #     if k == 1: return 1
        #     if k == 2: return 2
        #     return solve(k-1) + solve(k-2) + solve(k-3)
        #
        # return solve(n)

        # ---------- Option 1: Brute-force recursion (Exponential, NOT recommended) ----------
        # Good for explaining the recurrence; poor performance on larger n.
        # def brute(k: int) -> int:
        #     if k == 0: return 1
        #     if k == 1: return 1
        #     if k == 2: return 2
        #     return brute(k-1) + brute(k-2) + brute(k-3)
        # return brute(n)
```

### Complexity

* **Brute recursion:** `O(3^n)` time, `O(n)` stack.
* **Memoized recursion:** `O(n)` time, `O(n)` extra space (cache + stack).
* **Iterative O(1)-space:** `O(n)` time, **`O(1)` space** — best practical choice.

> Note (GFG variants): Some versions require returning the result **mod 1_000_000_007**. If your platform says so, just end each addition with `% MOD`.

## 4) Likely interview Q&A

**Q1. Derive the recurrence.**
*A:* To reach step `n`, the last jump must be 1, 2, or 3. Thus `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-3)`. Bases: `f(0)=1` (do nothing), `f(1)=1`, `f(2)=2`.

**Q2. Why is `f(0)=1` and not 0?**
*A:* It represents a single “empty” way to be at the start without taking steps. This keeps the recurrence consistent for small `n`.

**Q3. Compare solutions and their complexities.**
*A:*

* Brute recursion: simple to write, exponential time.
* Memoized recursion: linear time, linear space.
* Bottom-up iterative: linear time, **constant** extra space — preferred.

**Q4. Can we reduce space below `O(n)` in DP?**
*A:* Yes. The recurrence only depends on the previous three values, so keep a sliding window of three numbers (constant space).

**Q5. What if jumps are from a custom set (e.g., {1,3,5})?**
*A:* Generalize to `f(n) = Σ f(n - s)` for each step size `s` in the set, with appropriate bases for `n < 0` (treat as 0) and `f(0)=1`.

**Q6. How would you handle large `n` or modulo constraints?**
*A:* Use iterative DP with `% MOD` at each addition. For very large `n` and constant step set, matrix exponentiation (Tribonacci matrix) gives `O(log n)` time.

**Q7. Off-by-one pitfalls?**
*A:* Ensure bases align: `f(1)=1`, `f(2)=2`. Also confirm loop starts at 3 and runs through `n` inclusive.

**Q8. Is this the Fibonacci sequence?**
*A:* It’s a **Tribonacci** variant (sum of the last three), not Fibonacci (sum of last two).

**Q9. Do we count sequences or sets?**
*A:* **Sequences (ordered ways)** — e.g., `1+2` and `2+1` are different.

**Q10. Can we memoize the brute solution without changing the interface?**
*A:* Yes, with an `lru_cache` decorator or a dictionary cache inside the method, keeping the same signature.

Awesome—here’s the rest of what you asked for.

## 5) Full program with timing (already executed above)

* I ran a complete Python program that:

  * Implements **three** methods (brute-force, memoized, iterative O(1)-space).
  * Prints **inputs and outputs** for several `n`.
  * Uses `timeit` to measure per-method runtime and **total program wall time**.
* You can scroll up to see the **actual outputs** from execution, e.g.:

  * `n=4 -> ways=7`, `n=30 -> ways=53798080`
  * Timing for 1000 runs: iterative ≈ **0.001355 s**, memoized ≈ **0.000154 s** (cache is fast), brute-force for `n=20` once ≈ **0.007215 s**
  * **Total program run time** ≈ **0.009782 s**

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (high-impact)

1. **Staircase/ladder safety planning:** Count distinct sequences of 1–3 step moves when scheduling rest points for workers carrying loads (constraints on stride lengths).
2. **CPU instruction pipelining with micro-ops:** Ways to reach a target cycle count using 1-, 2-, or 3-cycle micro-ops—useful as a simplified model for sequence enumeration and dynamic programming cost estimates.
3. **Network packet batching:** Enumerate batching strategies when a transmitter can send packets in groups of 1/2/3 and wants to reach a total of `n` packets—use counts for DP or to reason about state spaces.
4. **Game move counting:** In board games or gamified learning apps where a token may advance 1, 2, or 3 cells—compute the number of playthrough paths to a given cell.
