Given string `s` containing characters as integers only, the task is to delete all characters of this string in a minimum number of steps wherein one step you can delete the substring which is a palindrome. After deleting a substring remaining parts are concatenated.

### Example 1

**Input:** `s = "2555432"`
**Output:** `2`
**Explanation:** In first step remove `"55"`, then string becomes `"23432"` which is a palindrome.

### Example 2

**Input:** `s = "1234"`
**Output:** `4`
**Explanation:** Remove each character in each step.

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function `minStepToDeleteString()` which string `s` as input parameters and returns the integer value.

**Expected Time Complexity:** `O(|s|^3)`
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** `O(|s|^2)`

**Constraints:** `1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^3`

got it—here’s the cleaned-up, interview-ready package based on the **correct** DP rewrite.

# 2) Explanation + step-by-step dry run

## Problem recap

You’re given a digit-string `s`. In **one step** you may delete **any palindromic substring** (contiguous). After deletion, the remaining parts concatenate. Find the **minimum steps** to delete the entire string.

## Core idea (interval DP that’s correct)

Let `dp[i][j]` = minimum steps to delete `s[i..j]` (inclusive).

Two essential moves:

1. **Split anywhere**
   Delete `s[i..k]` and `s[k+1..j]` separately:
   `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])` for all `k ∈ [i, j-1]`.

2. **Join equal ends**
   If `s[i] == s[j]`, we can plan to delete **both ends together in the last step** after clearing the middle, so:
   `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1])`.

Base cases:

* `dp[i][i] = 1` (single char is a palindrome).
* For length 2: `dp[i][i+1] = 1` if equal, else `2`.

This DP naturally captures “delete an internal palindrome so the outside becomes a palindrome next.”

---

## Dry run on the tricky case

`s = "2553432"` (0-indexed)

* Length 1: all `dp[i][i] = 1`.
* Length 2: only `"55"` at indices `(1,2)` is a palindrome → `dp[1][2] = 1`; others are `2`.

Consider the whole string `i=0, j=6` (`"2553432"`):

* Ends equal? `s[0]='2'`, `s[6]='2'` ⇒ yes, so candidate `dp[1][5]`.
* Evaluate `dp[1][5]` for `"55343"`:

  * Ends not equal (`'5'` vs `'3'`), so try splits:

    * Split at `k=2`: left `dp[1][2] = 1` (the `"55"`), right `dp[3][5]` (`"343"`).

      * For `"343"`: ends equal ⇒ `dp[4][4] = 1`. So `dp[3][5] = 1`.
    * Thus `dp[1][5] ≤ 1 + 1 = 2`.
* Therefore for the whole range: `dp[0][6] ≤ dp[1][5] = 2`.
  No split can beat 2, hence answer = **2**.

Sequence interpretation:

1. Delete the internal palindrome `"55"` → string becomes `"23432"`.
2. `"23432"` is a palindrome → delete in one step. Done.

Another quick check: `s="1234"`

* No equal ends ever align to save steps; DP reduces to splitting into singletons → **4**.

# 3) Python solutions (interview-friendly)

### A) Bottom-up (tabulation) — **correct O(n³)/O(n²)**, simple and robust

```python
#User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def minStepToDeleteString(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0:
            return 0

        # dp[i][j] = min steps to delete s[i..j]
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        # length 1 substrings -> 1 step
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1

        # length 2 substrings
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dp[i][i + 1] = 1 if s[i] == s[i + 1] else 2

        # length >= 3
        for length in range(3, n + 1):
            for i in range(0, n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1

                best = float('inf')

                # Option 1: if ends equal, plan to remove both ends together
                # after clearing the middle (so no extra +1 here)
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    best = min(best, dp[i + 1][j - 1])

                # Option 2: split into two parts and sum
                for k in range(i, j):
                    best = min(best, dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j])

                dp[i][j] = best

        return dp[0][n - 1]
```

**Why interviewers like this:** very clear recurrence, easy to justify correctness with interval DP induction.

### B) Top-down (memoized recursion) — same logic, easier to derive on a whiteboard

```python
#User function Template for python3
class Solution:
    def minStepToDeleteString(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        from functools import lru_cache

        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def solve(i, j):
            # empty/invalid interval
            if i > j:
                return 0
            # single char
            if i == j:
                return 1
            # length 2 shortcut
            if j == i + 1:
                return 1 if s[i] == s[j] else 2

            # Option 1: join equal ends
            best = float('inf')
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                best = min(best, solve(i + 1, j - 1))

            # Option 2: split anywhere
            for k in range(i, j):
                best = min(best, solve(i, k) + solve(k + 1, j))

            return best

        return solve(0, n - 1)
```

**Note:** Both versions match the expected bounds: **Time `O(n³)`**, **Space `O(n²)`**.

# 4) Likely interviewer Q&A

**Q1. What does `dp[i][j]` represent and why interval DP?**
`dp[i][j]` is the minimum steps to delete `s[i..j]`. Deletions affect only contiguous ranges and cause concatenation, so optimal substructures are contiguous intervals → interval DP is natural.

**Q2. Why is `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]` allowed when `s[i]==s[j]`?**
Because we can schedule the **final** deletion to remove both ends together, after first deleting the middle optimally. No additional `+1` is needed here: the “step” that removes the ends is the same step that removes the palindrome formed at the end.

**Q3. Why do we also need the split transition?**
When ends don’t match—or even if they do but it’s still cheaper—an optimal plan may delete the range in two (or more) sections. Taking `min` over all splits ensures optimality.

**Q4. Base cases?**

* `dp[i][i] = 1` (one char).
* For length 2, `1` if equal else `2`.
  They anchor the recurrence for longer substrings.

**Q5. Complexity analysis?**
There are `O(n²)` states; each state tries `O(n)` splits (and at most one ends-merge check), hence `O(n³)` time. Space is `O(n²)`.

**Q6. Can we precompute palindromes to speed up?**
You can precompute `isPal[i][j]` in `O(n²)` and immediately set `dp[i][j]=1` for those ranges. This speeds practical runtime on palindrome-heavy inputs but doesn’t change worst-case `O(n³)`.

**Q7. Why doesn’t a greedy “delete the largest palindrome first” work?**
Removing a huge palindrome early can block better pairings later. The DP’s split/merge considers all possibilities, while greedy can miss sequences where removing a smaller inner palindrome enables a one-shot deletion of the remainder.

**Q8. How to reconstruct the actual deletions?**
Maintain a `choice[i][j]` while filling DP: store either “join ends” or the `k` that gave the best split. Then backtrack from `(0, n-1)` to list which substrings to delete in order.

sweet — here’s a full, self-contained package you can paste into a file and run.

It includes:

* the **correct DP** (bottom-up) in your required class template,
* a **top-down memoized** variant for comparison (optional),
* a tiny **driver** that runs a few inputs (including `2553432`) and prints outputs,
* **timing** using `time.perf_counter()` (same clock used by `timeit` under the hood),
* inline comments that state **time & space complexity** of each significant step.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few important ones)

* **Text compression via structured deletions:** Modeling the minimum operations to erase content when only certain structured deletions (e.g., palindromic blocks or balanced tokens) are allowed—useful as a toy model for grammar-aware compression/cleanup.

* **DNA/RNA palindromic motif processing:** Palindromic sequences (reverse complements) often matter in genomics. A similar DP can model minimal “cleavage” or editing steps when enzymes act on palindromic sites.

* **Code refactoring with symmetric patterns:** When refactors can remove symmetric code blocks in one step, the DP helps estimate minimal passes to fully clean a codebase under constrained operations.
