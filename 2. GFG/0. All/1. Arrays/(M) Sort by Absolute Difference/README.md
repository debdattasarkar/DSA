## Problem Statement

You are given a number **x** and an array **arr\[]**. Your task is to rearrange the elements of the array according to the **absolute difference** with **x**, i.e., an element having minimum difference comes first, and so on.

**Note:** If two or more elements are at equal distances, arrange them in the same sequence as in the given array.

---

## Examples

**Input:**
x = 7, arr\[] = \[10, 5, 3, 9, 2]
**Output:**
\[5, 9, 10, 3, 2]
**Explanation:**
Sorting the numbers according to the absolute difference with 7, we have array elements as 5, 9, 10, 3, 2.

---

**Input:**
x = 6, arr\[] = \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
**Output:**
\[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
**Explanation:**
Sorting the numbers according to the absolute difference with 6, we have array elements as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

## 2) Explanation + Step‚Äëby‚Äëstep dry run

### Problem recap

Given an array `arr` and a number `x`, rearrange `arr` so that elements appear in **increasing order of their absolute difference** to `x`. If two elements are **equally close**, keep them in the **same relative order** as in the original array (stable).

### Key ideas

* Sort by key = `abs(a - x)`.
* Stability matters for ties. Python‚Äôs `list.sort()` / `sorted()` is **stable**, so equal keys preserve original order automatically. (If using a language without stable sort, pair each value with its original index and use that as a tie‚Äëbreaker.)

### Dry run

Input: `x = 7`, `arr = [10, 5, 3, 9, 2]`

Compute diffs:

* 10 ‚Üí |10‚Äì7| = 3
* 5  ‚Üí |5‚Äì7|  = 2
* 3  ‚Üí |3‚Äì7|  = 4
* 9  ‚Üí |9‚Äì7|  = 2
* 2  ‚Üí |2‚Äì7|  = 5

Sort by diff (stable for ties):

* diff 2: 5, 9   (order kept: 5 before 9)
* diff 3: 10
* diff 4: 3
* diff 5: 2

Result: **\[5, 9, 10, 3, 2]**

Another: `x = 6`, `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Diffs: 5,4,3,2,1 ‚Üí result **\[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]**.

## 3) Optimized Python solutions (brute & interview‚Äëexpected)

### A) Interview‚Äëexpected (stable sort by key) ‚Äî O(n log n) time, O(1) extra\*

\*O(1) extra if sorting the array in-place; otherwise O(n) to build a new list.

```python
class Solution:
    def rearrange(self, arr, x):
        # Time: O(n log n) due to sort
        # Space: O(1) extra if sorting in place (Python's Timsort is in-place); otherwise O(n).
        # Python's sort is stable, so ties keep original order automatically.
        arr.sort(key=lambda a: abs(a - x))
        return arr
```

### B) Brute force (stable selection by minimal diff) ‚Äî O(n¬≤) time, O(1) space

```python
class Solution:
    def rearrange(self, arr, x):
        # Time: O(n^2) - selection-like process
        # Space: O(1)
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            # find index of minimal |arr[j]-x| in [i..n-1];
            # first minimal keeps stability relative to earlier elements
            best = i
            best_diff = abs(arr[i] - x)
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                d = abs(arr[j] - x)
                if d < best_diff:              # strictly smaller diff wins
                    best = j
                    best_diff = d
            # stable place by extracting best and inserting at i
            val = arr.pop(best)
            arr.insert(i, val)
        return arr
```

### C) Bucket (counting‚Äëstyle, explicitly stable) ‚Äî O(n + D) time, O(n + D) space

Where `D = max(|arr[i]-x|)`. Useful if `D` is small compared to `n log n`.

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def rearrange(self, arr, x):
        # Time: O(n + D) where D = max absolute difference
        # Space: O(n + D)
        if not arr:
            return arr
        diffs = [abs(a - x) for a in arr]
        D = max(diffs)
        buckets = [deque() for _ in range(D + 1)]  # index = diff
        for a in arr:                               # fill buckets in original order -> stability
            buckets[abs(a - x)].append(a)
        out = []
        for d in range(D + 1):
            out.extend(buckets[d])
        return out
```

## 4) Interviewer Q\&A (quick hits)

**Q1. How do you guarantee stability for equal absolute differences?**

* In Python, `sort` is stable; sorting with key `abs(a - x)` preserves input order for ties.
* In non‚Äëstable sorts/languages, pair `(abs(a-x), original_index, value)` or perform a stable algorithm (e.g., stable mergesort).

**Q2. Time and space complexity of your main solution?**

* Sorting by key is `O(n log n)` time and `O(1)` extra memory in-place (Python‚Äôs Timsort). Returning a new list costs `O(n)` extra.

**Q3. Can we do better than `O(n log n)`?**

* If values are integers and `D = max(|a-x|)` is small, a bucket (counting)-style solution runs in `O(n + D)`. Otherwise, comparison sort lower bound applies.

**Q4. What edge cases do you consider?**

* Empty array; single element; all elements equal; all elements at same distance from `x` (must remain unchanged); very large `x` or values causing large diffs.

**Q5. Why not use a custom comparator comparing concatenations (like ‚Äúlargest number‚Äù problem)?**

* That‚Äôs a different problem. Here the ordering is solely `abs(a - x)` with stability on ties.

Here‚Äôs a ready-to-run script that:

* Implements the three approaches (Stable Sort, Bucket when range is small, and Brute/Selection).
* Annotates time & space at each step right in the code.
* Runs a small main with sample inputs and measures runtime via `timeit`.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (high-impact)

1. **Recommendations by Similarity**
   Show products/users/documents ordered by distance to a target embedding/score, while preserving original ranking for ties. Stable ordering avoids jitter when equal scores occur.

2. **Nearest-Neighbor UI Lists**
   In geo apps (e.g., restaurants near me), sort by distance from the user‚Äôs location. If multiple places are at the same distance (e.g., same mall), keep their catalog ordering.

3. **Alert Prioritization**
   Security/ops dashboards often sort events by deviation from a threshold. Equal deviations preserve ingestion order so operators don‚Äôt see alerts ‚Äúflip-flopping‚Äù on refresh.

4. **Cache Prefetching / Memory Heuristics**
   Rank pages/blocks by distance from a current pointer/offset and preserve trace order for equal distances to maintain predictable prefetch patterns.
