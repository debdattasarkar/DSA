## üìú Problem Statement

Given an array **arr[]**, where each element is at most **k positions away** from its correct position in the sorted order.
Your task is to **restore the sorted order** of `arr[]` by rearranging the elements **in place**.

---

> **Note:** Don‚Äôt use any built-in `sort()` method.

---

## üß† Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 4], k = 2
```

**Output:**

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Explanation:**
All elements are at most `k = 2` positions away from their correct positions.

* Element 1 moves from index 2 ‚Üí 0
* Element 2 moves from index 0 ‚Üí 1
* Element 3 moves from index 1 ‚Üí 2
* Element 4 stays at index 3

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
arr[] = [7, 9, 14], k = 1
```

**Output:**

```
[7, 9, 14]
```

**Explanation:**
All elements are already stored in the sorted order.

| `1 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10‚Å∂`     |            |

## 2) Intuition + step-by-step dry run

**Given:** every element is at most **k** positions away from where it would appear in the fully sorted array.

**Key fact:**
At index `i` of the final sorted array, the correct element must be among indices `[i, i+k]` of the current array (can‚Äôt be farther left than `i` and can‚Äôt be more than `k` places to the right).

**Greedy with a min-heap (priority queue):**

1. Put the first `k+1` elements into a **min-heap** (the smallest among them belongs at position `0`).
2. Repeatedly:

   * Pop the heap‚Äôs min and write it to the next output position.
   * Push the next unseen array element (keeps the heap representing the next window of size `k+1`).
3. After the input is exhausted, pop out all remaining heap items.

Because each element is at most `k` away, the correct item for position `i` will **always** be in that heap.

### Dry run

`arr = [2, 3, 1, 4]`, `k = 2`

* Build heap from first `k+1 = 3` elements: heap = `[1, 3, 2]` (min at top = 1)
* i = 0: pop ‚Üí `1`, write to `arr[0]`; push next element `4`
  heap becomes `[2, 3, 4]`, array now `[1, 3, 1, 4]` (we‚Äôre overwriting in place by index)
* i = 1: pop ‚Üí `2`, write to `arr[1]`; (no next element to push yet)
  heap becomes `[3, 4]`, array `[1, 2, 1, 4]`
* i = 2: pop ‚Üí `3`, write to `arr[2]` ‚Üí `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, heap `[4]`
* i = 3: pop ‚Üí `4`, write to `arr[3]` ‚Üí `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, heap `[]`

Sorted, and every heap operation touched only `k+1` candidates.

## 3) Optimized Python solutions (interview-favorite + easy brute)

### A) ‚úÖ Min-heap (optimal, expected by interviewers)

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def nearlySorted(self, arr, k):
        """
        Min-heap of size k+1
        Time  : O(n log k)   (each of n pushes/pops is log(k+1))
        Space : O(k)         (heap only)
        """
        n = len(arr)
        if n <= 1 or k <= 0:
            return arr  # already sorted or trivial

        # 1) Build heap from first k+1 elements
        heap = arr[:k+1]
        heapq.heapify(heap)        # O(k)

        write = 0                  # next position to place smallest element

        # 2) For remaining elements, push new, pop min to 'write'
        for read in range(k+1, n):
            smallest = heapq.heapreplace(heap, arr[read])  # pop min + push arr[read]
            arr[write] = smallest
            write += 1

        # 3) Drain the heap
        while heap:
            arr[write] = heapq.heappop(heap)
            write += 1

        return arr
```

### B) üü° Simple ‚Äúselection over window‚Äù (easy to remember, O(n¬∑k))

Pick the minimum from the next `k+1` window and swap to the current position.

```python
class Solution:
    def nearlySorted(self, arr, k):
        """
        Windowed selection: for each i, find min in arr[i : i+k+1] and swap to i.
        Time  : O(n * k)      (scan up to k+1 items per position)
        Space : O(1) extra
        Good when k is tiny and you want the simplest code without heaps.
        """
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            # search the range [i, min(i+k, n-1)]
            end = min(i + k, n - 1)
            min_idx = i
            for j in range(i+1, end+1):
                if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                    min_idx = j
            if min_idx != i:
                arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
        return arr
```

> Either solution rearranges **in place** (the array itself becomes sorted).

---

## 4) Interview quick-recall + likely Q&A

### 5-line pseudo-code (say this first)

```
push first k+1 items to min-heap
for each remaining item:
    pop min ‚Üí write next position
    push current item
drain heap popping to array
```

**Mnemonic:** **‚ÄúHeap k+1 ‚Üí Pop/Push ‚Üí Drain.‚Äù**

### Typical questions

* **Why heap size `k+1`?**
  Because any element can be at most `k` to the right of its sorted position; therefore the correct item for position `i` must be within indices `[i, i+k]` ‚Üí at most `k+1` candidates.

* **Complexity?**
  `O(n log k)` time, `O(k)` extra space.

* **Can you do it without extra space?**
  Strictly `O(1)` auxiliary while still `O(n log k)` is hard; the heap is the standard approach. A windowed selection is `O(nk)` time but `O(1)` space.

* **What if `k = 0` or `k = 1`?**
  `k=0` ‚Üí already sorted; `k=1` ‚Üí either already sorted or single local swap suffices; heap still works.

---

### Bonus: Modified insertion sort (also O(n¬∑k))

You can mention: ‚ÄúBecause elements move at most `k` places left, insertion sort that shifts at most `k` elements per iteration runs in `O(nk)`.‚Äù

Awesome‚Äîhere are a few **high-impact, easy-to-explain real-world uses** plus a **complete, runnable Python program** for the ‚ÄúNearly Sorted (k-sorted) array‚Äù problem with inline complexity notes and timings.

---

## 5) Real-World Use Cases (why this problem exists)

* **Streaming logs / telemetry ordered by time with bounded jitter (k):**
  Network delays and batching make events arrive slightly out of order (each event at most `k` places from its correct time). A **min-heap of size k+1** reorders them online in `O(n log k)`.

* **Merge phase of external sorting / k-way merge buffers:**
  When records are pulled from multiple nearly ordered buffers, the global stream becomes **k-sorted**. A small heap restores full order efficiently.

* **Task scheduling / priority queues with bounded skew:**
  Tasks come roughly sorted by priority or deadline, but each is off by ‚â§ `k`. Heap-based reordering gives a ready-to-execute, fully sorted list.

* **Sensor fusion / time-series alignment:**
  Packets from multiple sensors arrive nearly in order; reorder them cheaply without a full `O(n log n)` sort.

> ‚ÄúBecause each element is at most `k` away, the correct value for position `i` must be among the next `k+1` elements. I keep a **min-heap of size k+1**, pop the smallest into place, and push the next element‚Äîthis sorts in **O(n log k)** time and **O(k)** space. If I needed the simplest code, I could do a **windowed selection** in **O(nk)** time.‚Äù
