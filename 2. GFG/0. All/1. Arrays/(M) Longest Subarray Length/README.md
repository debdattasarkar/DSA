## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr[]`. Your task is to find the **length of the longest subarray** such that **all the elements of the subarray are smaller than or equal to the length of the subarray**.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `arr[] = [1, 2, 3]`
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** The longest subarray is the entire array itself, which has a length of 3. All elements in the subarray are less than or equal to 3.

### Example 2

**Input:** `arr[] = [6, 4, 2, 5]`
**Output:** `0`
**Explanation:** There is no subarray where all elements are less than or equal to the length of the subarray. The longest subarray is empty, which has a length of 0.

---

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
* `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(n)`

Awesome—let’s unpack **exactly what your (correct) monotonic-stack solution is doing**, dry-run it, and then I’ll give two interview-ready implementations (your O(n) stack version and a simple O(n²) brute-force checker) plus a quick interviewer Q\&A.

## 2) Explanation + step-by-step dry run

### Problem (rephrased)

Find the **maximum length L** of a contiguous subarray whose **maximum element ≤ L**.

### Key observation

For any index `i`, if we know the **nearest strictly-greater** element to the **left** and to the **right** of `i`, then the largest window centered around `i` in which `arr[i]` stays the maximum is:

```
(left[i] + 1) … (right[i] - 1)
length L_i = right[i] - left[i] - 1
```

If `arr[i] ≤ L_i`, then this whole window is a valid subarray.
So the answer is `max L_i` over all `i` that satisfy `arr[i] ≤ L_i`.

### How we get nearest strictly-greater

* Pass 1 (left→right): build `right[i]` using a **strictly decreasing** stack (pop while `< current`).
* Pass 2 (right→left): build `left[i]` similarly.
* Then scan once to compute the best `L_i` that meets `arr[i] ≤ L_i`.

### Dry run 1 — `arr = [6, 4, 2, 5]` (the tricky one)

1. Build `right` (nearest strictly-greater to the right):

* Start `right = [4,4,4,4]` (n=4 default means “none”).
* i=0 (6) → stack=\[0]
* i=1 (4) → 6<4? no → stack=\[0,1]
* i=2 (2) → 4<2? no → stack=\[0,1,2]
* i=3 (5) → pop 2 (2<5) ⇒ `right[2]=3`; pop 1 (4<5) ⇒ `right[1]=3`; 6<5? no → push 3
  → `right = [4,3,3,4]`

2. Build `left` (nearest strictly-greater to the left):

* Start `left = [-1,-1,-1,-1]`
* i=3 (5) → stack=\[3]
* i=2 (2) → 5<2? no → stack=\[3,2]
* i=1 (4) → pop 2 (2<4) ⇒ `left[2]=1`; 5<4? no → stack=\[3,1]
* i=0 (6) → pop 1 (4<6) ⇒ `left[1]=0`; pop 3 (5<6) ⇒ `left[3]=0`; push 0
  → `left = [-1,0,1,0]`

3. Evaluate candidates:

* i=0: L=4−(−1)−1=4, need 6≤4? ✗
* i=1: L=3−0−1=2, need 4≤2? ✗
* i=2: L=3−1−1=1, need 2≤1? ✗
* i=3: L=4−0−1=3, need 5≤3? ✗
  No valid i → **answer = 0** ✅

### Dry run 2 — `arr = [1, 2, 3]`

* `right = [3, 3, 3]`, `left = [-1, 0, 1]`, `L = [3, 2, 1]`
* Check: (1≤3 ✓ → 3), (2≤2 ✓ → 2), (3≤1 ✗)
* **answer = 3** ✅

## 3) Python solutions (optimized + brute)

### A) Optimized O(n) (your monotonic-stack idea; interview-ready)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, arr):
        """
        For each index i, find nearest strictly-greater element on the left and right
        using two monotonic decreasing stacks. The maximal window where arr[i] is the
        maximum is (left[i]+1 .. right[i]-1) of length L_i. If arr[i] <= L_i, it's a
        valid candidate. Return the best L_i.

        Time  : O(n)   (each index pushed/popped at most once per pass)
        Space : O(n)
        """
        n = len(arr)
        if n == 0:
            return 0

        # nearest strictly-greater to the right, default n
        right = [n] * n
        stack = []
        for i in range(n):
            while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
                right[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)

        # nearest strictly-greater to the left, default -1
        left = [-1] * n
        stack.clear()
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
                left[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)

        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            length = right[i] - left[i] - 1  # maximal span with arr[i] as max
            if arr[i] <= length:
                ans = max(ans, length)
        return ans
```

### B) Brute force O(n²) (useful as a verifier)

```python
class SolutionBrute:
    def longestSubarray(self, arr):
        """
        Try every subarray, track the max, check condition max <= length.
        Time  : O(n^2)
        Space : O(1)
        """
        n = len(arr)
        best = 0
        for i in range(n):
            cur_max = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                cur_max = max(cur_max, arr[j])
                L = j - i + 1
                if cur_max <= L:
                    best = max(best, L)
        return best
```

> Interview tip: start with the brute to show clarity, then derive the O(n) stack method by arguing about “nearest greater on both sides” and why that gives the maximal span per index.

---

## 4) Likely interviewer questions (with concise answers)

**Q1. Why strictly-greater (not ≥) for boundaries?**
We need the **first index where value becomes larger than `arr[i]`** to ensure `arr[i]` is the unique max within the span; equal values wouldn’t stop the span, so we pop on `<` and keep equals on the stack.

**Q2. Why is the span `(left[i]+1 … right[i]-1)` maximal?**
Because stepping beyond either boundary hits a value `> arr[i]`, so `arr[i]` would no longer be the max in that larger window.

**Q3. Why is checking only centers `i` sufficient?**
Any valid subarray has a maximum at some index `i`. That subarray’s length ≤ the maximal span around `i`. If it’s valid, `arr[i] ≤ subarray_len ≤ L_i`, so `arr[i] ≤ L_i` holds for that `i`.

**Q4. Complexity?**
Two linear passes with monotonic stacks → **O(n)** time, **O(n)** extra space.

**Q5. Common pitfall?**
Returning the length of the longest run of “values ≤ threshold” without verifying the **threshold equals the run length**. Here the condition is **`max ≤ length`**, not “max ≤ global threshold”.

* implements the **O(n) monotonic-stack** solution (your correct one),
* includes a **O(n²) brute** for sanity checks,
* prints answers for a few sample inputs,
* and measures total runtime with `timeit` when you run the file.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few important ones)

1. **Rate-Limiter & Burst Windows**
   You may need the longest time window where the observed peak rate doesn’t exceed the window size (e.g., #requests ≤ window length). This “max ≤ length” constraint appears when sizing windows dynamically.

2. **Quality Control / Batch Sizing**
   In production lines, choose the largest contiguous batch where the worst item tolerance (max defect severity) is still acceptable for the batch size (e.g., smaller batches tolerate higher max values; larger batches need lower max values).

3. **Network Packet Batching**
   When coalescing packets, you might accept a batch only if the largest packet fits a rule tied to the batch size (e.g., MTU/overhead rules). You then want the biggest contiguous window meeting a “peak ≤ window length” constraint.
