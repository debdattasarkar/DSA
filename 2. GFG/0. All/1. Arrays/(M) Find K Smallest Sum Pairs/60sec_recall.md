Perfect — this is exactly how top candidates keep calm in an interview.
Let’s make it short, visual, and **recallable in 60 seconds**.

## 🧠 “5-Line Pseudo-Code Template” (heap-based K smallest sum pairs)

Think of it as **“Start, Pop, PushRight, PushDown, Repeat.”**

### 🔹 5-line skeleton

```
heap = [(arr1[0] + arr2[0], 0, 0)]         # Start with smallest pair
while k > 0 and heap:
    sum, i, j = pop smallest from heap      # Get current smallest sum pair
    output [arr1[i], arr2[j]]               # Add to result
    push (i, j+1) if within bounds          # Move right in arr2
    if j == 0: push (i+1, 0) if within bounds # Move down to next row once
```

## 🧩 Mnemonic: **“SPPRD” → Speak it as “SP-PERD”**

| Letter | Meaning                          | Mental cue            |
| :----: | :------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
|  **S** | **Start** heap with `(0,0)`      | smallest + smallest   |
|  **P** | **Pop** from heap                | get next min pair     |
|  **P** | **Push Right** `(i, j+1)`        | same row, next column |
|  **R** | **Row down once** `(i+1, 0)`     | only when `j == 0`    |
|  **D** | **Decrement k / Done when k==0** | stop after k          |

Say it like a rhythm before interviews:

> “Start–Pop–PushRight–RowDown–Done.”

## ⚡ 60-Second Recall Checklist

Before walking into your interview, silently walk through:

1. **Arrays sorted?** → Yes → use heap.
2. **Init heap** → `(arr1[0] + arr2[0], 0, 0)`
3. **Each pop gives next smallest** → output it.
4. **Push two candidates:**

   * `(i, j+1)` always (move right)
   * `(i+1, 0)` only when `j==0` (move down)
5. **Stop after k pairs.**

✅ **That’s it.**
If you can recall “SPPRD” and draw a 2D grid in your head (rows = arr1, cols = arr2),
you can rebuild the full heap code in **under 30 seconds in any language**.
