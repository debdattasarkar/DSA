## üßæ Problem Statement

Given an integer `k` and a **queue** of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first **k** elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

---

## üõ† Allowed Operations

Only the following **standard operations** are allowed on queue:

* `enqueue(x)` : Add an item `x` to rear of queue
* `dequeue()` : Remove an item from front of queue
* `size()` : Returns number of elements in queue
* `front()` : Finds front item

> **Note:** The above operations represent the general processing. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem.

---

## üí° Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
`k = 3`, `queue[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
**Output:**
`3 2 1 4 5`
**Explanation:**
After reversing the given input from the 3rd position the resultant output will be `3 2 1 4 5`.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**
`k = 4`, `queue[] = [4, 3, 2, 1]`
**Output:**
`1 2 3 4`
**Explanation:**
After reversing the given input from the 4th position the resultant output will be `1 2 3 4`.

---

## üîí Constraints

* $1 \leq k \leq \text{queue.size()} \leq 10^5$

---

## ‚è± Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Auxiliary Space:** O(k)

## ‚úÖ 2. Text Explanation with Step-by-Step Dry Run

### üîπ Problem Statement

You're given a queue of integers and an integer `k`. Your task is to reverse the **first `k` elements** of the queue and leave the **rest of the queue unchanged**, maintaining their relative order.

---

### üîπ Approach

We will use a **stack** to reverse the first `k` elements, then reinsert them back into the queue and **rotate** the remaining elements to maintain their relative order.

---

### üîπ Dry Run

#### Example:

Input:

```
k = 3  
queue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Step 1: Push first `k` elements to stack**
stack = \[1, 2, 3] ‚Üí top of stack is 3

**Step 2: Pop all from stack and enqueue back to queue**
queue = \[4, 5, 3, 2, 1]

**Step 3: Move the (n-k) remaining elements to back**
(2 elements: 4, 5)
‚Üí dequeue and enqueue them back

Final queue = \[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]

‚úÖ Output: `3 2 1 4 5`

        for _ in range(k):
            stack.append(q.get())  # O(k)

        # Step 2: Enqueue stack elements back into queue
        while stack:
            q.put(stack.pop())  # O(k)

        # Step 3: Move the remaining (size-k) elements to the rear
        size = q.qsize()

## ‚úÖ 4. Interview Questions & Answers

---

### üí¨ Q1: Why is a stack used to reverse the queue?

**A:** A stack reverses the order of elements due to its LIFO nature. So pushing first `k` elements into a stack and popping them back reverses them.

---

### üí¨ Q2: Can we solve this problem without using a stack?

**A:** Yes, using recursion or a deque, but a stack gives a simple and efficient O(k) solution with O(k) space.

---

### üí¨ Q3: What is the time complexity?

**A:**

* Reversing first `k` elements: O(k)
* Reinserting: O(k)
* Rotating remaining: O(n - k)
  ‚û°Ô∏è **Total Time: O(n)**

---

### üí¨ Q4: What is the space complexity?

**A:**

* Stack stores `k` elements
  ‚û°Ô∏è **Auxiliary Space: O(k)**

---

### üí¨ Q5: What happens if `k > queue size`?

**A:** It's invalid. Constraints guarantee `1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ queue.size()`, so we don't need to handle it explicitly.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

* This solution uses the standard **"Reverse first k elements of a queue"** approach.
* It‚Äôs often seen in:

  * Queue rotation/reversal questions
  * System design buffers
  * Intermediate-level interview questions

# We arent calling Queue anywhere in the program?

In this code:

```python
from queue import Queue
```

We're **importing `Queue`**, but in the `modifyQueue()` method, we are **not creating a new `Queue` object** inside the function. Instead, we're assuming the input `q` **is already a `Queue` object** created *outside* the function (likely by the driver code or test harness).

---

### ‚úÖ Why the `Queue` import is necessary?

Because although you're not explicitly doing something like `q = Queue()` **inside** the function, the `Queue` class (from Python's `queue` module) must be imported **so that the object passed in has `.get()`, `.put()`, and `.qsize()` methods**, which are methods of `Queue`.

So the full lifecycle might look like:

```python
from queue import Queue

q = Queue()
for val in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    q.put(val)

sol = Solution()
k = 3
q = sol.modifyQueue(q, k)

# Print the modified queue
while not q.empty():
    print(q.get(), end=' ')
```

This is where the `Queue` object is **actually instantiated**, and then passed to `modifyQueue()`.

---

### üîÅ Summary

* ‚úÖ You **import** `Queue` to use `.get()`, `.put()`, `.qsize()`, etc.
* ‚ùå But you don‚Äôt need to **instantiate** `Queue()` inside the function unless you're creating a new queue yourself.
* ‚úÖ The input queue is expected to be created by the **caller** (e.g., main driver function or test framework).
