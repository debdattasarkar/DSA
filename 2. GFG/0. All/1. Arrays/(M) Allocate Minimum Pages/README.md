## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]` of integers, where each element `arr[i]` represents the number of pages in the i-th book. You also have an integer `k` representing the number of students. The task is to allocate books to each student such that:

1. Each student receives **at least one book**.
2. Each student is assigned a **contiguous sequence of books**.
3. No book is assigned to more than one student.

The **objective** is to **minimize the maximum number of pages** assigned to any student. In other words, out of all possible allocations, find the arrangement where the student who receives the most pages still has the **smallest possible maximum**.

📌 **Note**: If it is not possible to allocate books to all students, return `-1`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
`arr[] = [12, 34, 67, 90], k = 2`

**Output:**
`113`

**Explanation:**
Allocation can be done in the following ways:

* `[12]` and `[34, 67, 90]` → Maximum Pages = 191
* `[12, 34]` and `[67, 90]` → Maximum Pages = 157
* `[12, 34, 67]` and `[90]` → Maximum Pages = 113 ✅

The third combination has the minimum maximum pages assigned to a student, which is **113**.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**
`arr[] = [15, 17, 20], k = 5`

**Output:**
`-1`

**Explanation:**
Since there are **more students than total books**, it is impossible to allocate a book to each student.

---

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6`
* `1 ≤ arr[i], k ≤ 10^3`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n × log(sum(arr)))`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`

# 2) Intuition & step‑by‑step dry run

### Problem recap

Give `n` books in given order (`arr[i]` pages each) and `k` students.
Assign each student **one contiguous block** of books. Minimize the **maximum** pages any student gets. If `k > n`, return `-1`.

### Why binary search on the answer?

If we fix a cap `X` (max pages any student may receive) we can **greedily** scan the array and count how many students are needed if no student is allowed to exceed `X`.

* If we need **≤ k** students → `X` is feasible (maybe we can do with a smaller cap).
* If we need **> k** students → `X` is too small.

This is **monotone**: if a certain `X` works, any `Y ≥ X` also works. Hence we can binary search the minimum feasible `X`.

### Search range

* Lower bound `lo = max(arr)` (no student can get less than the biggest book).
* Upper bound `hi = sum(arr)` (one student takes all).

### Dry run (arr = \[12, 34, 67, 90], k = 2)

`lo = 90`, `hi = 203`.

1. `mid = (90 + 203)//2 = 146`.
   Greedily group under cap 146:

* Student#1: 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 (add 90 would exceed 146)
* Student#2: 90
  Used 2 students → feasible. Shrink right: `hi = 146`.

2. `mid = (90 + 146)//2 = 118`.

* Student#1: 12 + 34 + 67 = 113
* Student#2: 90
  2 students → feasible. `hi = 118`.

3. `mid = (90 + 118)//2 = 104`.

* Student#1: 12 + 34 = 46 (adding 67 exceeds 104)
* Student#2: 67
* Student#3: 90
  3 students → **not** feasible (need ≤ 2). Increase: `lo = 105`.

4. `mid = (105 + 118)//2 = 111`.

* \#1: 12 + 34 = 46 (adding 67 exceeds 111)
* \#2: 67 (adding 90 exceeds 111)
* \#3: 90
  3 students → not feasible. `lo = 112`.

5. `mid = (112 + 118)//2 = 115`.

* \#1: 12 + 34 + 67 = 113
* \#2: 90
  2 students → feasible. `hi = 115`.

6. `mid = (112 + 115)//2 = 113`.

* \#1: 12 + 34 + 67 = 113
* \#2: 90
  2 students → feasible. `hi = 113`.

7. `mid = (112 + 113)//2 = 112`.

* \#1: 12 + 34 = 46 (adding 67 exceeds 112)
* \#2: 67 (adding 90 exceeds 112)
* \#3: 90
  3 students → not feasible. `lo = 113`.

Stop when `lo == hi == 113`. **Answer = 113**.

# 3) Python solutions (interview‑ready)

## A) Optimal & standard: Binary Search on answer + Greedy check

```python
class Solution:
    def findPages(self, arr, k):
        """
        Time:  O(n log(sum(arr)))   where n = len(arr)
        Space: O(1)
        """
        n = len(arr)
        # Edge cases
        if k > n:
            return -1
        if k == 1:
            return sum(arr)
        if k == n:
            return max(arr)

        def can_distribute(cap: int) -> bool:
            """Return True if we can assign books to <= k students
            such that no one gets more than 'cap' pages."""
            students = 1
            cur = 0
            for pages in arr:
                if pages > cap:  # single book exceeds cap -> impossible
                    return False
                if cur + pages <= cap:
                    cur += pages
                else:
                    students += 1
                    cur = pages
                    if students > k:
                        return False
            return True

        lo, hi = max(arr), sum(arr)
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if can_distribute(mid):
                hi = mid      # feasible -> try smaller cap
            else:
                lo = mid + 1  # infeasible -> need larger cap
        return lo
```

### Why the greedy works

Given a fixed cap, the best way to not exceed it while minimizing students is to **fill the current student as much as possible** before starting a new one. Any other split would use **≥** as many students.

---

## B) DP alternative (clarity trade‑off): Minimize maximum load by partition DP

This is classic “partition array into `k` contiguous parts minimizing the maximum sum”.

* `dp[i][p]` = minimum possible maximum pages when partitioning the first `i` books among `p` students.
* Transition:

  ```
  dp[i][p] = min over j in [p-1 .. i-1] of  max(dp[j][p-1], sum(arr[j..i-1]))
  ```
* Use prefix sums for O(1) range sum.

**Complexity:** `O(k * n^2)` time, `O(k * n)` space (fine for smaller `n`).

```python
class SolutionDP:
    def findPages(self, arr, k):
        """
        DP Partition solution.
        Time:  O(k * n^2)
        Space: O(k * n)
        """
        n = len(arr)
        if k > n:
            return -1
        if k == 1:
            return sum(arr)
        if k == n:
            return max(arr)

        # prefix sums: ps[i] = sum of arr[0..i-1]
        ps = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            ps[i + 1] = ps[i] + arr[i]

        def rng_sum(l, r):
            # sum of arr[l..r], inclusive
            return ps[r + 1] - ps[l]

        # dp[p][i]: first i items -> p students (i from 0..n)
        INF = 10**18
        dp = [[INF] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[1][i] = rng_sum(0, i - 1)  # one student gets first i books

        for p in range(2, k + 1):
            for i in range(p, n + 1):      # at least p books to give p students
                # place the last cut at j (j books to first p-1 students)
                best = INF
                # j goes from p-1 .. i-1
                for j in range(p - 1, i):
                    last_block = rng_sum(j, i - 1)
                    best = min(best, max(dp[p - 1][j], last_block))
                dp[p][i] = best

        return dp[k][n]
```

> In interviews, the **binary search** version is the expected solution for large constraints; the **DP** version is great to discuss trade‑offs and alternative approaches.

# 4) Interview Q\&A (what you’ll likely be asked)

**Q1. Why is binary search applicable here?**
Because the predicate “`cap` is feasible” is **monotonic**: if a certain cap works, any larger cap also works. Monotonic predicates are perfect for binary search.

**Q2. Why does the greedy feasibility check work?**
Given a fixed cap, pushing as many consecutive books as possible to the current student never increases the number of required students compared to any other split. So the greedy produces the **minimum** students for that cap.

**Q3. What are your bounds for the search?**
`lo = max(arr)` (a student must at least handle the largest single book) and `hi = sum(arr)` (one student takes all).

**Q4. What if `k > n`?**
Not possible to give each student at least one book → return `-1`.

**Q5. Do we sort the array?**
No. Sorting would break the **contiguous** constraint. The given order of books must be preserved.

**Q6. Complexity of your optimal method?**
`O(n log(sum(arr)))` time and `O(1)` extra space.

**Q7. How does the DP compare?**
DP is `O(k * n^2)` time and `O(k * n)` space. It’s intuitive but not scalable for large `n` (e.g., up to 1e5). Binary search + greedy is preferred.

**Q8. Can integer overflow happen?**
In Python, integers are arbitrary precision. In languages with fixed-width ints, use 64‑bit types (`long long`).

**Q9. Any quick shortcut cases?**

* `k == 1` → `sum(arr)`
* `k == n` → `max(arr)`
* `k > n` → `-1`

## 6) Real‑World Use Cases (only the most important)

1. **Workload partitioning / batch processing**
   Split a sequential stream of tasks (e.g., log files by day) among `k` workers so the **slowest worker’s load** is minimized while preserving natural ordering constraints.

2. **Video editing / media encoding**
   Assign consecutive segments of a video or audio timeline to `k` render nodes such that the **longest render time** is as small as possible; segments must stay contiguous for codec constraints.

3. **Book printing / bindery lines**
   Distribute consecutive chapters (varying pages) to parallel printing/binding lines to **minimize the maximum pages** a line handles while keeping chapters in order.

4. **Backup / archival chunking**
   Split a sequence of files (must remain in order for recovery) across `k` tapes/drives so that the **largest assigned size** is minimized.

These maps precisely to “contiguous partitions with minimized maximum bucket sum,” i.e., the same abstraction you just implemented.
