## üìò Problem Statement

You are given a **grid[][]** of size **n √ó m**, where every element is either `'O'` or `'X'`.
You have to **replace all 'O' (or groups of 'O') with 'X'** that are **completely surrounded by 'X'** on all sides.

A `'O'` (or a set of `'O'`) is considered to be **surrounded by 'X'** if there are `'X'` cells just **below**, **above**, **left**, and **right** of it (no connection to border).

---

## üß† Concept

* Think of all `'O'` cells that are **connected to the border** ‚Äî they **cannot** be replaced (since they are not surrounded by `'X'` on all sides).
* Any other `'O'` (not connected to border `'O'`) is **truly surrounded** ‚Üí replace it with `'X'`.

---

## üß© Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```python
grid = [
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'O']
]
```

**Output:**

```python
[
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'O']
]
```

**Explanation:**
We only changed those `'O'` that were **completely surrounded by `'X'`**.
The `'O'`s on the bottom border remain unchanged.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```python
grid = [
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'O']
]
```

**Output:**

```python
[
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'O']
]
```

**Explanation:**
No `'O'` is fully surrounded by `'X'`.
All `'O'`s are connected to the border (directly or indirectly), so none are changed.

---

### Example 3

**Input:**

```python
grid = [
    ['X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'X']
]
```

**Output:**

```python
[
    ['X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'X']
]
```

**Explanation:**
There‚Äôs only one `'O'` in the middle, completely surrounded by `'X'` ‚Üí it gets replaced.

Awesome‚Äîthis is the classic **‚ÄúSurrounded Regions‚Äù** pattern. I‚Äôll give you:

1. a clear explanation with a tiny step-by-step dry run,
2. interview-ready Python in your exact signature: **DFS** (most common), **BFS** alternative, plus a **simple brute** to illustrate why we don‚Äôt use it,
3. a 60-second recall mnemonic + high-yield Q&A.

---

## 2) Text explanation + dry run

### Problem in one line

Replace every `'O'` that is **not connected to the border** (via up/down/left/right) with `'X'`.

### Key idea (optimal, expected in interviews)

* Any `'O'` touching the **border** (directly or through a chain of `'O'`s) is **safe** and must **stay `'O'`**.
* All other `'O'`s are **trapped** (surrounded) and must be turned to `'X'`.

So we:

1. **Mark all border-connected 'O's** (via DFS/BFS) as **SAFE** (e.g., temporarily mark `'S'`).
2. **Flip remaining 'O' ‚Üí 'X'** (they‚Äôre surrounded).
3. **Restore 'S' ‚Üí 'O'** (keep safe zones).

This touches each cell **O(n¬∑m)** once.

### Tiny dry run

Input:

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

Rows=4, Cols=4.

1. Start from borders and flood-fill (4-neighbors) only on `'O'`:

   * Border O at (3,1) ‚Üí mark as `S`. Its up neighbor (2,1) is `X` so stop.
   * No other border O.

After marking SAFE:

```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X S X X
```

2. Flip remaining unmarked `'O'` ‚Üí `'X'`:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X S X X
```

3. Restore `'S'` ‚Üí `'O'`:

```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

Only the region touching the border remained `'O'`. Others got surrounded and flipped.

## 3) Python solutions (brute ‚Üí optimal), with inline comments

Signature you asked for:

```python
class Solution:
    def fill(self, grid):
        # Code here
```

### A) DFS (border-marking), **expected** solution ‚Äî O(n¬∑m) time, O(n¬∑m) space (recursion/stack)

```python
class Solution:
    def fill(self, grid):
        """
        Mark border-connected 'O' as SAFE via DFS, flip the rest.
        Time  : O(n*m)  -- each cell visited at most once
        Space : O(n*m)  -- recursion stack worst-case + grid in-place
        """
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return grid

        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        # 4-directional moves
        DIRS = ((1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1))

        def in_bounds(r, c):
            return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols

        def dfs(r, c):
            # Mark this 'O' as SAFE ('S') to avoid flipping later
            grid[r][c] = 'S'
            for dr, dc in DIRS:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if in_bounds(nr, nc) and grid[nr][nc] == 'O':
                    dfs(nr, nc)

        # 1) Seed DFS from all border 'O's
        for r in range(rows):
            if grid[r][0] == 'O': dfs(r, 0)
            if grid[r][cols-1] == 'O': dfs(r, cols-1)
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[0][c] == 'O': dfs(0, c)
            if grid[rows-1][c] == 'O': dfs(rows-1, c)

        # 2) Flip interior 'O' -> 'X'
        # 3) Restore SAFE 'S' -> 'O'
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 'O':
                    grid[r][c] = 'X'   # surrounded
                elif grid[r][c] == 'S':
                    grid[r][c] = 'O'   # safe

        return grid
```

### B) BFS (queue) variant ‚Äî same complexity, iterative (useful if recursion depth is a concern)

```python
from collections import deque

class SolutionBFS:
    def fill(self, grid):
        """
        Iterative BFS from border 'O's to mark SAFE cells.
        Time  : O(n*m)

        """
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return grid

        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        q = deque()

        def push_if_border_O(r, c):
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] == 'O':
                grid[r][c] = 'S'     # mark as SAFE upon enqueue (avoid repeats)
                q.append((r, c))

        # 1) Enqueue all border 'O's and mark as SAFE
        for r in range(rows):
            push_if_border_O(r, 0)
            push_if_border_O(r, cols - 1)
        for c in range(cols):
            push_if_border_O(0, c)
            push_if_border_O(rows - 1, c)

        # 2) BFS flood to mark all connected 'O's as SAFE
        while q:
            r, c = q.popleft()
            for dr, dc in ((1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)):
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                push_if_border_O(nr, nc)

        # 3) Flip interior 'O' -> 'X', restore 'S' -> 'O'
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 'O': grid[r][c] = 'X'
                elif grid[r][c] == 'S': grid[r][c] = 'O'

        return grid
```

### C) Brute (educational): flood every `'O'` and check if region touches border ‚Äî O(n¬∑m) but slower constants

```python
from collections import deque

class SolutionBrute:
    def fill(self, grid):
        """
        For each unvisited 'O', BFS its region; if region touches border, keep it,
        else flip whole region to 'X'.
        Time  : O(n*m) overall (each cell enters exactly one region BFS)
        Space : O(n*m) for visited/queue
        """
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return grid

        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visited = [[False]*cols for _ in range(rows)]

        def on_border(r, c):
            return r == 0 or r == rows-1 or c == 0 or c == cols-1

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 'O' and not visited[r][c]:
                    q = deque([(r, c)])
                    visited[r][c] = True
                    region = [(r, c)]
                    touches_border = on_border(r, c)

                    while q:
                        x, y = q.popleft()
                        for dx, dy in ((1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)):
                            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == 'O':
                                visited[nx][ny] = True
                                q.append((nx, ny))
                                region.append((nx, ny))
                                if on_border(nx, ny):
                                    touches_border = True

                    # Flip region only if it does NOT touch border
                    if not touches_border:
                        for x, y in region:
                            grid[x][y] = 'X'

        return grid
```

> In interviews, prefer **DFS or BFS border-marking** (A or B). The brute is fine as a warmup explanation.

## 4) 60-second recall + interviewer Q&A

### Mnemonic (say it once before coding)

**‚ÄúBorder ‚Üí Mark Safe ‚Üí Flip Others ‚Üí Restore.‚Äù**
Or shorter: **‚ÄúB‚ÄìM‚ÄìF‚ÄìR.‚Äù**

* **Border:** start from every border `'O'`.
* **Mark Safe:** flood-fill to mark border-connected region (use `'S'`).
* **Flip Others:** any remaining `'O'` is surrounded ‚Üí flip to `'X'`.
* **Restore:** `'S'` ‚Üí `'O'`.

### Likely Q&A

**Q1. Why start from borders?**
Surrounded regions are exactly those **not** connected to the border. Border flood-fill labels all ‚Äúescape to border‚Äù areas as safe.

**Q2. Time/space complexity?**
Each cell is processed a constant number of times ‚Üí **O(n¬∑m)** time.
Extra memory for recursion/queue/visited ‚Üí **O(n¬∑m)** worst-case.

**Q3. DFS vs BFS?**
Either works. DFS is concise; BFS avoids deep recursion (stack overflow) on very large grids.

**Q4. Why mark as `'S'` and not a boolean visited only?**
You can use either. Using `'S'` lets us **avoid another array** and makes the final restore step straightforward.

**Q5. Diagonals allowed?**
No‚Äîonly 4-direction connectivity (up/down/left/right) counts, per problem statement.

**Q6. Can we do it truly in-place?**
Yes‚Äîby marking with `'S'` (or a sentinel) and restoring later; no separate visited array is required (DFS version).

---

---

Great‚Äîwrapping this up with (5) crisp real-world uses and (6) a **complete, runnable program** (DFS + BFS), with clear inline complexity notes and timings.

---

## 5) Real-World Use Cases (interview-friendly)

1. **Capture regions in image segmentation**
   Pixels = grid cells. ‚ÄúForeground‚Äù (`'O'`) touching the border is background leak; only fully enclosed blobs should be filled‚Äîexactly this problem.

2. **Maze/room sealing in games**
   Flood from outer boundary to mark rooms reachable from outside; any `'O'` not touched is a sealed chamber ‚Üí fill with walls.

3. **Map water fill (lakes vs ocean)**
   On an elevation grid reduced to `'O'` water and `'X'` land: border-connected water is **ocean**; enclosed `'O'` pools are **lakes** ‚Üí convert to land.

4. **UI/Canvas paint-bucket with boundaries**
   When user ‚Äúfills‚Äù with a color, don‚Äôt cross the global frame edges: mark outside-connectivity; fill only bounded areas.

5. **Security zoning**
   Floor plan cells: mark zones accessible from exits (borders). Enclosed accessible `'O'` regions with no border path are restricted and can be ‚Äúsealed‚Äù.

## 6) Full Program (DFS + BFS, outputs + timings)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Replace O's with X's (Surrounded Regions)
-----------------------------------------
Approaches:
  A) DFS border-marking (class Solution)        -> O(n*m) time, O(n*m) space (recursion)
  B) BFS border-marking (class SolutionBFS)     -> O(n*m) time, O(n*m) space (queue)

The algorithmic pattern:

**What you‚Äôll see when you run it**

* For each example: input grid, DFS output, BFS output (they match).
* **Single-run** microsecond timings and **average** timings via `timeit`.
* Inline comments clearly state the time/space complexity at each step‚Äîgreat for interviews.
