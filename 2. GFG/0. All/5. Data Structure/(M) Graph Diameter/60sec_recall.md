Perfect — here are (5) crisp, relatable use cases, then a complete, runnable Python program (with inline complexity notes, sample inputs, outputs, and timing using both `perf_counter` and `timeit`).

---

## 5) Real-World Use Cases (interview-friendly)

1. **Network latency extremes**
   Model servers/routers as nodes and links as unit edges; graph diameter ≈ worst-case hop count between two points → guides where to add links/caches.

2. **Social graph “six degrees” check**
   Users as nodes, friendships as edges; diameter is the longest shortest chain connecting any two users in a connected component.

3. **Road network inside a campus/park**
   Intersections as nodes, unit edges for equal-length paths (or weighted variant for real distances). Diameter shows the farthest two points by steps.

4. **Tree data structures health**
   In trees (e.g., organizational chart, AST), the diameter is the longest chain — helps detect deep chains that may cause stack limits or latency.

5. **Sensor/IoT placement**
   Devices in a mesh network: minimize diameter to bound worst-case multi-hop message time.

## 6) Full Program (two approaches + timings)

* Implements:

  * **Two-BFS (by component)** → classic, most expected (`O(V+E)`).
  * **Single DFS (tree-style)** → elegant, also `O(V+E)` (works per component too).
* Prints outputs for the two sample graphs from the prompt.
* Shows single-run and averaged timings.

Graph Diameter — Full Program with Timings
------------------------------------------
Two methods:
  1) two_bfs_diameter_forest (most expected): O(V+E) time, O(V) space
  2) one_dfs_diameter_forest (tree-style):    O(V+E) time, O(V) space

We treat the input as an undirected graph. If disconnected (a forest),
we compute the diameter per connected component and take the maximum.

### What you’ll see when running

* For each example, it prints the **Two-BFS** result and the **One-DFS** result (both should match expected).
* Shows **single-run** microsecond timings and **average** timings via `timeit`.
* Inline comments note **time/space** at each step — easy to cite during interviews.
