## 2) Explanation (clear idea + dry run)

### Goal

Return a list of strings that are the binary representations of all integers from **1 to n**, in order.

### Two common ways

1. **Brute / direct conversion (simple and fine for interviews):**
   Loop `i = 1..n`, convert `i` to binary string (e.g., `bin(i)[2:]`) and push to result.

2. **Queue (BFS) generation (classic pattern, O(n) without repeated division):**
   Think of a binary tree of strings where each node‚Äôs children are `node + "0"` and `node + "1"`.
   Start with `"1"` in a queue; pop front, append it to the answer, then push its two children. Repeat `n` times. This produces binary numbers in increasing order.

Both are **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space (to store the output). The queue method is a favorite for this problem because it demonstrates mastery of BFS/queue patterns.

---

### Dry run (Queue method) for `n = 6`

* Start: `q = ["1"]`, ans = \[]

1. Pop `"1"` ‚Üí ans = `["1"]`; push `"10"`, `"11"` ‚Üí q = `["10","11"]`
2. Pop `"10"` ‚Üí ans = `["1","10"]`; push `"100"`, `"101"` ‚Üí q = `["11","100","101"]`
3. Pop `"11"` ‚Üí ans = `["1","10","11"]`; push `"110"`, `"111"` ‚Üí q = `["100","101","110","111"]`
4. Pop `"100"` ‚Üí ans = `["1","10","11","100"]`; push `"1000"`, `"1001"` ‚Üí q = `["101","110","111","1000","1001"]`
5. Pop `"101"` ‚Üí ans = `["1","10","11","100","101"]`; push `"1010"`, `"1011"` ‚Üí q = `["110","111","1000","1001","1010","1011"]`
6. Pop `"110"` ‚Üí ans = `["1","10","11","100","101","110"]`; (stop after 6 items)

Output: `["1", "10", "11", "100", "101", "110"]`

## 3) Optimized Codes (two interview-friendly ways)

### A) Direct conversion (brute/easy)

```python
class Solution:
    def generateBinary(self, n):
        """
        Brute/easy approach: convert each i in [1..n] to binary.
        Time  : O(n) average (conversion is O(log i), but total is bounded by output size)
        Space : O(n) for the result list
        """
        res = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # bin(i) returns strings like '0b101', so strip the '0b' prefix
            res.append(bin(i)[2:])
        return res
```

### B) BFS with a queue (classic optimal pattern)

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def generateBinary(self, n):
        """
        Queue/BFS approach: generate strings in increasing order by expanding each node to x0, x1.
        Time  : O(n)   (we pop/push constant work per item)
        Space : O(n)   (queue + result)
        """
        if n <= 0:
            return []
        
        res = []
        q = deque()
        q.append("1")  # start from 1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            cur = q.popleft()     # the next binary number
            res.append(cur)
            q.append(cur + "0")   # generate next two numbers in sequence
            q.append(cur + "1")
        
        return res
```

> **Which to pick in an interview?**
> If the interviewer wants simplicity and speed: use **A**.
> If they hinted ‚Äúqueue/bit magic/without using built-ins‚Äù or want a data-structure pattern: show **B**.

## 4) Likely Interview Q\&A

**Q1. Why does the BFS queue produce numbers in increasing order?**
**A.** Starting with `"1"`, each pop is the smallest unreported binary string. Appending `"0"` and `"1"` keeps lexicographic growth aligned with numeric order for these specific prefixes, so the sequence matches 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶ in binary.

**Q2. What are the time and space complexities?**
**A.** Both methods are `O(n)` time overall (bounded by generating `n` strings; queue method does constant work per item). Space is `O(n)` for storing the output; the queue method also has `O(n)` auxiliary space.

**Q3. Any edge cases?**
**A.** `n = 1` ‚Üí `["1"]`. `n <= 0` ‚Üí return empty list. Very large `n` ‚Üí ensure you don‚Äôt print or store unnecessarily huge intermediates beyond the required list.

**Q4. Why not generate via repeated division by 2 manually?**
**A.** You can; it‚Äôs similar to `bin(i)[2:]`. The queue method avoids repeated log-time conversions and showcases DS skills.

**Q5. Will leading zeros ever appear?**
**A.** No. The generation starts at `"1"` and only appends `"0"`/`"1"` to existing non-zero prefixes.

**Q6. Which approach is more memory efficient?**
**A.** Both store `n` strings in the result‚Äîso output dominates. The queue temporarily holds up to \~`O(n)` entries, similar order of growth as the result itself.

Here‚Äôs a **complete, runnable** Python program that:

* Implements **both approaches** (direct conversion and BFS/queue).
* Prints **inputs and outputs** (for small demo inputs).
* Uses `timeit` to measure **end-to-end runtime** for each approach.
* Includes **inline complexity notes** right where the work happens.

Generate Binary Numbers from 1..n

Two implementations:
  1) Direct conversion using Python's bin()  ‚Äî simple & fast in practice.
  2) BFS/Queue generation ‚Äî classic interview pattern (no integer->binary conversion).

Time & Space Overview (both methods):
  - Time  : O(n) total work to produce n strings (queue does O(1) per produced item;
             direct conversion is amortized O(1) per item given small integer sizes
             in many interview settings, strictly it‚Äôs O(sum log i) but bounded by output size).
  - Space : O(n) to store the output list (dominant). Queue approach also uses O(n) queue space.

1. **Streaming ID generators / numbering labels**
   Generating compact identifiers (binary) up to a limit, or producing codes for testing parsers/encoders.

2. **Educational tooling**
   Teaching binary representations, BFS/queue behavior, or enumerating states in increasing order of magnitude.

3. **Bitmask iteration scaffolding**
   When building demos or unit tests that need binary masks from 1 to n (e.g., subsets in combinatorial problems).

4. **Low-level protocol/debug visualization**
   Displaying flags or bit-fields in human-readable binary when inspecting packets or hardware registers.
