## üß© Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` of time strings in **24-hour clock format** `"HH:MM:SS"`, return the **minimum difference in seconds** between any two time strings in the `arr[]`.

üï∞ **Note:**
The clock wraps around at midnight, so the time difference between `"23:59:59"` and `"00:00:00"` is 1 second.

## üß™ Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: arr[] = ["12:30:15", "12:30:45"]
Output: 30
Explanation: The minimum time difference is 30 seconds.

## ‚úÖ 2. Text Explanation with Step-by-Step Dry Run

### üß† **Problem Summary:**

Given a list of time strings in `"HH:MM:SS"` 24-hour format, find the **minimum difference in seconds** between any two times. The time wraps around at midnight.

### üí° **Key Observations:**

* Convert all times to **total seconds since midnight**.
* Sort the times.
* Compute **differences between consecutive times**.
* Also compute the **circular difference** between the first and last time.
* Return the **minimum** of these differences.

---

### üõ† Dry Run:

**Input:**

```python
arr = ["00:00:01", "23:59:59", "00:00:05"]
```

**Step 1: Convert to seconds**

* `"00:00:01"` ‚Üí `1`
* `"23:59:59"` ‚Üí `86399`
* `"00:00:05"` ‚Üí `5`

List becomes: `[1, 5, 86399]`

**Step 2: Sort it:**
‚Üí `[1, 5, 86399]`

**Step 3: Differences between consecutive times:**

* `5 - 1 = 4`
* `86399 - 5 = 86394`

**Step 4: Wrap-around difference (midnight):**

* `86400 + 1 - 86399 = 2`

**Final answer:** `min(4, 86394, 2) = 2`

## ‚úÖ 3. Optimized Python Code (Expected in Interviews)

### ‚úÖ Efficient (O(n log n) due to sort)

```python
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, arr):
        # Helper to convert "HH:MM:SS" to seconds
        def to_seconds(t):
            h, m, s = map(int, t.split(":"))
            return h * 3600 + m * 60 + s

        # Convert all times to seconds
        times = [to_seconds(t) for t in arr]

        # Sort times
        times.sort()

        # Initialize min_diff as max possible (1 day in seconds)
        min_diff = float('inf')
        n = len(times)

        # Compare adjacent times
        for i in range(1, n):
            diff = times[i] - times[i - 1]
            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)

        # Also check circular diff between last and first
        wrap_around = 86400 + times[0] - times[-1]  # 86400 = 24*60*60
        min_diff = min(min_diff, wrap_around)

        return min_diff
```

### ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity:

* **Time:** O(n log n) ‚Äì for sorting
* **Space:** O(n) ‚Äì for storing converted seconds

## ‚úÖ 4. Interview Questions & Answers

### üí¨ Q1: Why do we need to consider the wrap-around at midnight?

**A:** Because the clock resets at 00:00:00, the difference between `"23:59:59"` and `"00:00:01"` is **2 seconds**, not 86398.

---

### üí¨ Q2: Can we solve it without sorting?

**A:** Not efficiently. Since we need to find minimum differences between **closest** times, sorting helps bring closest times together for adjacent comparison.

---

### üí¨ Q3: What is the maximum time difference possible in 24 hours?

**A:** `86399` seconds. That‚Äôs `23:59:59`.

---

### üí¨ Q4: Why use 86400 in wrap-around?

**A:** A full day has `86400` seconds. So if the smallest time is at start and the largest is near midnight, the difference is calculated as:

```
86400 - (latest - earliest)
```
