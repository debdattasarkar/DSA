## Problem Statement

Given two strings **s** and **p**. Find the smallest substring in **s** consisting of all the characters (**including duplicates**) of the string **p**.

Return empty string in case no such substring is present.

If there are multiple such substrings of the same length found, return the one with the **least starting index**.

---

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "timetopractice", p = "toc"
Output: "toprac"
Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest substring in which "toc" can be found.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "zoomlazapzo", p = "oza"
Output: "apzo"
Explanation: "apzo" is the smallest substring in which "oza" can be found.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "zoom", p = "zooe"
Output: ""
Explanation: No substring is present containing all characters of p.
```

---

## Constraints

* $1 \leq s.length(), p.length() \leq 10^6$
* **s, p** consists of lowercase English letters

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$
* **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

Here’s a tight, interview-style package for **Smallest window containing all characters**.

---

# 2) Explanation + step-by-step dry run

### Core idea

We need the **shortest substring of `s` that contains all characters of `p` including duplicates**.
Use a **sliding window** with frequency counts:

* `need[c]` = how many times we still need character `c`.
* Expand the right end `r` to include characters.
* Once the window covers all required counts, shrink the left end `l` as much as possible while still valid. Track the best (shortest) window.

Because the alphabet is fixed (lowercase English), frequency arrays are O(1) space.

### Dry run (s = `"timetopractice"`, p = `"toc"`)

`need = {t:1, o:1, c:1}`, initially `formed=0` (number of chars whose window count reached `need`).

* r=0 `'t'`: have `t:1` → meets `need` → `formed=1`. Not all met.
* r=1 `'i'`: irrelevant.
* r=2 `'m'`: irrelevant.
* r=3 `'e'`: irrelevant.
* r=4 `'t'`: extra `t`.
* r=5 `'o'`: have `o:1` → `formed=2`.
* r=6 `'p'`: irrelevant.
* r=7 `'r'`: irrelevant.
* r=8 `'a'`: irrelevant.
* r=9 `'c'`: have `c:1` → `formed=3` (all met).

Now **shrink** from left `l=0` while window remains valid:

* Window `[0..9] = "timetoprac"`, valid.
* Move `l=1`, window `"imetoprac"` still has `t,o,c`? yes (we have another `t` at index 4).
* `l=2` → `"metoprac"` valid.
* `l=3` → `"etoprac"` valid.
* `l=4` → `"toprac"` valid (still has `t,o,c`).
* `l=5` → would drop `o`, becoming invalid.

So the best window is `"toprac"` (length 6). Continue moving `r` to end—no shorter valid window appears. **Answer: `"toprac"`**.

---

# 3) Python solutions (brute then optimized)

## A) Brute force (simple but slow, good to explain trade-offs)

* For each `l`, expand `r` to the right until the window contains all of `p` (using a fresh counter check each time), record min, then move `l` and repeat.
* Time: worst-case $O(n^2 \cdot \Sigma)$ where $\Sigma$ is alphabet size (26).
* Space: $O(\Sigma)$.

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestWindow(self, s: str, p: str) -> str:
        n, m = len(s), len(p)
        if m > n:
            return ""

        # frequency we need for each char in p
        need = [0] * 26
        for ch in p:
            need[ord(ch) - 97] += 1

        def covers(freq):
            # returns True if current 'freq' >= 'need' component-wise
            for i in range(26):
                if freq[i] < need[i]:
                    return False
            return True

        best_len = float('inf')
        best_l = -1
        # try every left boundary
        for l in range(n):
            freq = [0] * 26  # rebuild counts for each l (brute)
            for r in range(l, n):
                freq[ord(s[r]) - 97] += 1
                if covers(freq):
                    if r - l + 1 < best_len:
                        best_len = r - l + 1
                        best_l = l
                    break  # minimal r for this l; move l forward

        return "" if best_l == -1 else s[best_l:best_l + best_len]
```

## B) Optimized sliding window (expected in interviews)

* Maintain window counts incrementally.
* Track `formed`: number of characters whose required count has been satisfied.
* Whenever `formed == required`, try to shrink from the left to minimize.
* Time: $O(n)$ (each pointer moves at most n times).
* Space: $O(\Sigma)$ → effectively $O(1)$.

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestWindow(self, s: str, p: str) -> str:
        n, m = len(s), len(p)
        if m > n:
            return ""

        # 1) Build required frequency and count how many distinct letters we need
        need = [0] * 26
        for ch in p:
            need[ord(ch) - 97] += 1
        required = sum(1 for x in need if x > 0)

        # 2) Sliding window state
        have = [0] * 26                   # counts in current window
        formed = 0                        # how many chars currently meet their need
        best_len = float('inf')
        best_l = 0
        l = 0

        # 3) Expand right pointer
        for r, ch in enumerate(s):
            ci = ord(ch) - 97
            have[ci] += 1
            # did we just satisfy a needed character?
            if need[ci] > 0 and have[ci] == need[ci]:
                formed += 1

            # 4) If all req'd letters are satisfied, shrink from left
            while formed == required:
                if r - l + 1 < best_len:
                    best_len = r - l + 1
                    best_l = l

                left_ci = ord(s[l]) - 97
                have[left_ci] -= 1
                # did we break the requirement for this char?
                if need[left_ci] > 0 and have[left_ci] < need[left_ci]:
                    formed -= 1
                l += 1

        return "" if best_len == float('inf') else s[best_l:best_l + best_len]
```

### Notes interviewers love:

* If there are multiple answers with the same length, **earliest starting index** wins automatically because we only update when we find a **strictly** smaller length.
* `required` counts **distinct** needed characters, not total length of `p`.
* Space is $O(1)$ because the alphabet is bounded (26 lowercase letters).

# 4) Common interviewer Q\&A

**Q1. Why does the sliding window run in O(n)?**
Because each index is visited by `l` and `r` at most once; we never move `l` backward and we only grow/shrink by one per step.

**Q2. How do you handle duplicates in `p`?**
`need[c]` stores exact multiplicities. `formed` only increases when the window’s count for `c` reaches `need[c]`, not just when it becomes non-zero.

**Q3. What if `p` contains characters not present in `s`?**
Then the window can never be valid. The algorithm returns `""` because `best_len` remains `inf`.

**Q4. Why use arrays over dictionaries?**
Given constraints say lowercase English letters; arrays of size 26 are faster and use constant space. With a larger alphabet, use `collections.Counter` or dict.

**Q5. How is the “least starting index” tie-break enforced?**
We only update the best when we find a **shorter** window. If lengths tie, we keep the earlier one already recorded.

**Q6. Edge cases?**

* `len(p) > len(s)` → immediately `""`.
* `p` is a single letter → first occurrence in `s`.
* All characters same in `p` (e.g., `"aaa"`) → window must have that many identical chars.

Awesome—here’s a clean, runnable script that includes:

* a clear, commented implementation (both **brute-force** and **optimal sliding window**),
* a tiny driver with sample inputs and printed outputs,
* and a `timeit` benchmark so you can see timings locally.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (important, concise)

1. **Log/trace analysis**
   Find the **shortest time window** in a log stream that contains all required events (e.g., “login”, “db”, “payment”) to debug issues quickly.

2. **Search highlighting**
   In a document or web page, return the **smallest snippet** that contains all query terms (with multiplicity), improving snippet relevance.

3. **Bioinformatics**
   Locate the **minimal DNA/RNA segment** that contains all required k-mers/markers (with counts) for targeted analysis.

4. **ETL/data quality checks**
   During streaming ingestion, detect the **smallest batch/window** that includes all mandatory record types before committing a micro-batch.

5. **Alert correlation**
   In security monitoring, find the **tightest interval** that contains all signals in an indicator set to raise a composite alert.
