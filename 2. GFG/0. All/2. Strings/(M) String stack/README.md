# String stack

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Accuracy:** 28.57%
**Points:** 4

You are given two strings `pat` and `tar` consisting of lowercase English characters. You can construct a new string `s` by performing **exactly one** of the following operations for **each character** in `pat` (from left to right):

* **Append** the current character `pat[i]` to the end of `s`.
* **Delete** the last character of `s` (if `s` is empty this operation does nothing).

After performing an operation for **every** character of `pat` exactly once, determine whether it is possible for the resulting string `s` to be **equal** to `tar`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `pat = "geueak"`, `tar = "geek"`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:**
Append the first three characters of `pat` → `s = "geu"`.
For `'a'`, delete last → `s = "ge"`.
Append `'e'`, then `'k'` → `s = "geek" == tar`.

---

### Example 2

**Input:** `pat = "agifghd"`, `tar = "gfg"`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:**
Skip `'a'` by choosing delete when `s` is empty (no effect).
Append `'g'`, `'i'` → `s = "gi"`.
For `'f'`, delete last → `s = "g"`.
Append `'f'`, `'g'`, `'h'` → `s = "gfgh"`.
For `'d'`, delete last → `s = "gfg" == tar`.

---

### Example 3

**Input:** `pat = "ufahs"`, `tar = "aus"`
**Output:** `false`
**Explanation:** It is impossible to construct `tar` from `pat` using the allowed per-character operations.

---

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ pat.size(), tar.size() ≤ 10^5`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`

---

## Topic Tags

* Strings
* Greedy
* Two-pointer-algorithm

Awesome — I’ll base everything on your parity-aware greedy solution. It’s the cleanest linear-time way to solve this.

# 2) Intuition + step-by-step dry run

## Problem in one line

You must process every character of `pat` exactly once, choosing either:

* **append** it to the end of the working string `s`, or
* **delete** the last character of `s` (no-op if `s` is empty).

After all characters are consumed, can you end with `s == tar`?

## Core idea (why parity matters)

If you commit some characters of `pat` to form `tar` in order at indices
`i1 < i2 < … < im` (0-based), then:

* Between two committed indices, all **non-matching** characters must be consumed in **pairs** (append junk + delete junk) so they don’t disturb the already built prefix.
  ⇒ The **gap length** `(ik – i(k-1) – 1)` must be **even**.
  ⇒ Equivalently, `ik – i(k-1)` is **odd**: committed indices must **alternate parity**.
* After the last committed index `im`, the **tail length** `(n-1 – im)` must be **even** as well.

From that,

* If `m` (len of `tar`) is **odd**, the first committed index `i1` must have the **same** parity as `(n-1)`.
* If `m` is **even**, `i1` must have the **opposite** parity to `(n-1)`.

Your code enforces exactly this: for each `tar[j]` it picks the **earliest `pat[i]` with the right parity**.

---

## Dry runs

### A) `pat="geuaek"`, `tar="geek"` → **True**

* `n=6` ⇒ last index parity `(n-1)=5` is **odd**.
  `m=4` (even) ⇒ `i1` parity must be **opposite** ⇒ **even**.
  Needed parities per match: `even, odd, even, odd`.
* Scan:

  * `i=0 (g, even)` matches `g` (needs even) → `j=1`
  * `i=1 (e, odd)` matches `e` (needs odd) → `j=2`
  * `i=4 (e, even)` matches `e` (needs even) → `j=3`
  * `i=5 (k, odd)` matches `k` (needs odd) → `j=4=m`
* Tail after last match is length 0 (even). ✅

### B) `pat="agiffghd"`, `tar="gfg"` → **True**

* `n=8` ⇒ `(n-1)=7` **odd**; `m=3` **odd** ⇒ `i1` must be **odd**.
  Needed parities: `odd, even, odd`.
* Scan:

  * `i=1 (g, odd)` matches `g` → `j=1`
  * `i=3 (f, odd)` doesn’t fit parity (needs even), skip
  * `i=4 (f, even)` matches `f` → `j=2`
  * `i=5 (g, odd)` matches `g` → `j=3=m`
* Tail after last match has length 2 (even). ✅

### C) Tricky one that breaks “match-ASAP” greedy

`pat="bmmbgfalayg"`, `tar="mba"` → **True**

* `n=11` ⇒ `(n-1)=10` **even**; `m=3` **odd** ⇒ `i1` must be **even**.
  Needed parities: `even, odd, even`.
* Scan:

  * `i=1 (m, odd)` wrong parity, skip
  * `i=2 (m, even)` match → `j=1`
  * `i=3 (b, odd)` match → `j=2`
  * `i=6 (a, even)` match → `j=3=m`
* Tail after `i=6` has length 4 (even). ✅

# 3) Python solutions (interview-ready)

All are in the requested format.

## (A) Parity-aware greedy — **O(n+m) time, O(1) space** (recommended)

```python
"""
class Solution:
    def stringStack(self, pat, tar):
        # Greedy: pick the earliest pat index for each tar char,
        # but only if its index has the required parity.
        # This guarantees all inter-gaps and the final tail are even,
        # so extra chars can be neutralized via append+delete pairs.

        n, m = len(pat), len(tar)
        if m == 0:
            return True  # empty target is always possible

        # Parity of the last index in pat (0-based)
        last_parity = (n - 1) & 1

        # If m is odd: i1 must have same parity as (n-1)
        # If m is even: i1 must have opposite parity to (n-1)
        first_parity = last_parity if (m & 1) else (last_parity ^ 1)

        j = 0  # how many characters of tar we have matched
        for i, c in enumerate(pat):
            if j < m:
                # committed indices alternate parity: even/odd/even/od...
                needed_parity = first_parity ^ (j & 1)
                if c == tar[j] and ((i & 1) == needed_parity):
                    j += 1

        # If we matched all tar, tail parity is already ensured by construction
        return j == m
"""
```

### Why it’s correct (30-sec proof sketch)

Picked indices alternate parity (odd gaps), and the last pick aligns with `(n-1)` parity so that the tail has even length. Hence uncommitted characters can always be canceled in pairs without disturbing the committed prefix.

---

## (B) Backward two-pointer — **O(n+m) time, O(1) space** (also great)

Think of every non-matching `pat[i]` near the end as spending **two** steps (append junk + delete junk) that net out to no change at the end.

```python
"""
class Solution:
    def stringStack(self, pat, tar):
        # Work backwards. If pat[i] doesn't match the next needed tar[j],
        # we can "burn" two ops (append junk, delete it) without changing tar,
        # so we move i -= 2. When it matches, we consume one tar char.

        i, j = len(pat) - 1, len(tar) - 1
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if pat[i] == tar[j]:
                i -= 1
                j -= 1              # commit this char
            else:
                i -= 2              # spend an append+delete pair

        return j < 0                # success if all tar was committed
"""
```

* This implicitly enforces the **even-tail** and **even-gap** rule: a mismatch burns 2 characters of `pat` at a time.

---

## (C) DP/DFS with memo (educational, not for big inputs) — **O(n·m)**

Good to explain state design, but avoid for `|pat|, |tar|` up to 1e5.

```python
"""
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def stringStack(self, pat, tar):
        n, m = len(pat), len(tar)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(i, j, buf):
            # i = next index in pat to process
            # j = how many of tar we've committed (prefix length)
            # buf = number of junk chars currently on the top (we only need its parity)
            if i == n:
                return j == m and buf == 0  # must end exactly at tar with empty top junk

            # Option 1: delete (pop) – only if something is on the top
            if buf > 0 and dfs(i + 1, j, buf - 1):
                return True

            # Option 2: append pat[i]
            c = pat[i]
            # If it matches next tar char and no junk is on top, we can grow tar
            if buf == 0 and j < m and c == tar[j] and dfs(i + 1, j + 1, 0):
                return True

            # Otherwise it's junk; it must later be deleted
            if dfs(i + 1, j, buf + 1):
                return True

            return False

        return dfs(0, 0, 0)

# 4) Interview Q\&A (the ones that usually come up)

**Q1. Why is a plain “`tar` is a subsequence of `pat`” check insufficient?**
Because after finishing `tar` you must still consume the rest of `pat`. Single deletes will pop your committed `tar`. You need every leftover character to be neutralizable in **pairs** (append+delete), so the **tail length must be even**. Similarly, gaps between committed characters must be even as well. That’s what the parity rule enforces.

**Q2. Where does the exact parity rule come from?**
Let committed indices be `i1 < … < im`. Between two commitments you can’t pop the committed prefix, so the first non-matching char must be an append, the next time you can undo is a delete — that’s **2** steps. Hence each gap must be **even** length, i.e., committed indices alternate parity. After the last commitment, the leftover tail must also be even to end on `tar`.

**Q3. Why does the parity-aware greedy always succeed if a solution exists?**
Among all valid solutions, you can left-shift each committed index for `tar[j]` to the **earliest index with the required parity** without breaking feasibility (because it preserves parity of gaps and doesn’t block future matches). Hence picking greedily with correct parity is safe and optimal.

**Q4. Complexity of your approaches?**

* Parity-aware greedy: `O(n + m)` time, `O(1)` space.
* Backward two-pointer: `O(n + m)` time, `O(1)` space.
* DFS/DP: `O(n·m)` worst-case time/space; only for small inputs or explanation.

**Q5. Corner cases?**

* `tar=""` → always `True`.
* `len(pat) < len(tar)` → `False`.
* All remaining chars after last match must be even count (both linear solutions enforce this).
* Repeated letters and scattered matches are fine — parity governs feasibility.

**Q6. Can there be multiple valid ways?**
Yes. The problem asks for existence; the greedy/two-pointer checks feasibility without reconstructing the exact sequence of operations.

Here’s a complete, runnable program that:

* Implements the **parity-aware greedy** solution you approved (plus a **backward two-pointer** variant for comparison).
* Prints results for a few representative inputs.
* Uses `timeit` inline in `main` to report per-call runtimes.
* Contains inline complexity notes right where the logic happens.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (high-value)

1. **Editor/Terminal macro validation**
   You recorded a keystroke macro that can only type a character or hit backspace once per incoming character of a script (`pat`). You want to check if it’s even possible to end up with the intended final buffer `tar` under those exact constraints.

2. **Automated log/sanitization pipelines**
   Given a stream where each character must be either written or rolled back (e.g., append/delete for masking or sampling), verify that a target redacted view can be produced without reordering or additional passes.

3. **Constrained streaming transforms**
   Low-latency systems that are only allowed to apply push/pop-like edits per item (e.g., hardware parsers, on-device filters). The parity rule gives a quick feasibility test for requested outputs.
