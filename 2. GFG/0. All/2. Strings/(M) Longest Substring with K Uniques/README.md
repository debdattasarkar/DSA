## üìÑ Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase alphabets and an integer `k`.
Your task is to **find the length of the longest substring** that contains **exactly `k` distinct characters**.

---

> **Note:** If no such substring exists, return **-1**.

---

## üìå Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input:
s = "aabacbebebe", k = 3

Output:
7

Explanation:
The longest substring with exactly 3 distinct characters is "cbebebe", which includes 'c', 'b', and 'e'.
```

---

### Example 2:

```
Input:
s = "aaaa", k = 2

Output:
-1

Explanation:
There's no substring with 2 distinct characters.
```

---

### Example 3:

```
Input:
s = "aabaaab", k = 2

Output:
7

Explanation:
The entire string "aabaaab" has exactly 2 unique characters 'a' and 'b', making it the longest valid substring.
```

### ‚úÖ Step-by-step Explanation + Dry Run

We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. We must **find the length of the longest substring** that contains **exactly `k` distinct characters**.

---

### üéØ Approach (Sliding Window + Hash Map)

We use the **sliding window** technique:

* Expand the window using a `right` pointer.
* Use a hash map (`char_freq`) to count the frequency of characters in the current window.
* If number of unique characters in the window exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the `left`.
* If it equals `k`, update `max_len`.

## ‚ùì Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is the optimal time and space complexity of this solution?

**A:**

* Time: **O(n)**
* Space: **O(k)**, for storing at most `k` characters in hash map.

---

### Q2: Why do we use a sliding window here?

**A:**
The sliding window allows us to dynamically adjust the substring while ensuring the number of distinct characters stays within the required count.

---

### Q3: What happens if no substring contains `k` unique characters?

**A:**
We return `-1` as specified in the problem.

---

### Q4: Why is a Hash Map preferred over a Set?

**A:**
A hash map lets us **track character frequencies** and cleanly delete characters whose count drops to 0‚Äîessential for shrinking the window efficiently.

---

### Q5: Can we solve this using brute-force?

**A:**
Yes, but it would be **O(n¬≤)** or **O(n¬≥)** depending on how substrings are generated and evaluated, which is not optimal for large strings.
