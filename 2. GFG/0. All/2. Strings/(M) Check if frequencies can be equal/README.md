## üß† Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting **only of lowercase alphabetic characters**, check whether it is possible to remove **at most one character** such that the **frequency of each distinct character** in the string becomes **the same**.

* Return **`true`** if it is possible,
* Otherwise, return **`false`**.

---

## üîç Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "xyyz"
Output: true
Explanation: Removing one 'y' will make frequency of each distinct character to be 1.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "xyyzz"
Output: true
Explanation: Removing one 'x' will make frequency of each distinct character to be 2.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "xxxxyyzz"
Output: false
Explanation: Frequency cannot be made same by removing at most one character.
```

## ‚úÖ Constraints:

* $1 \leq \text{s.size()} \leq 10^5$

---

## ‚è± Expected Time and Space Complexity:

* **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
* **Auxiliary Space**: $O(1)$

### ‚úÖ 1. **Text Explanation with Step-by-Step Dry Run**

#### üîç Problem Understanding:

We are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters. We need to determine if it is possible to **remove at most one character** from `s` so that **all remaining characters have the same frequency**.

---

### üí° **Approach:**

1. Count the frequency of each character.
2. Count how many times each **frequency** occurs using another hashmap.
3. Based on these frequency patterns, check if:

   * All characters already have the same frequency.
   * Only one character has a frequency different by 1 (and it occurs only once).
   * Only one character occurs once and can be removed.

---

### üîÅ **Dry Run Example 1**:

```
Input: "xyyzz"

Char Frequency:
x ‚Üí 1
y ‚Üí 2
z ‚Üí 2

Now frequency of frequencies:
{1: 1, 2: 2}

=> Remove one 'x' ‚Üí frequencies become {2: 2}
‚úÖ All characters have equal frequency
Return: True
```

---

### üîÅ **Dry Run Example 2**:

```
Input: "xxxxyyzz"

Frequencies:
x ‚Üí 4
y ‚Üí 2
z ‚Üí 2

Frequency of frequencies:
{4: 1, 2: 2}

Not possible to fix with one removal.
Return: False
```

## üß™ 3. Interview Questions and Mock Answers

### ‚ùìQ1: How do you approach a frequency-based problem?

**A**: I first count character frequencies using a hash map. Then I analyze the pattern of frequency counts ‚Äî whether they are all same or if we can adjust by removing one character.

---

### ‚ùìQ2: Can you explain the time and space complexity of your solution?

**A**:

* **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
* **Space Complexity**: O(1) ‚Äì we use fixed-size hash maps since characters are only lowercase alphabets.

---

### ‚ùìQ3: Why do we check the frequency of frequencies?

**A**: Because we want all characters to appear the same number of times. If we can reduce one character or one frequency to match the rest, then it's a valid transformation.

---

### ‚ùìQ4: What if the input is an empty string?

**A**: The problem guarantees that the string has at least one character (`1 <= s.size()`). If not, we can return `true` or `false` based on specifications.

---

Here is the **visual dry run** for the input `s = "xyyzz"` for the problem: **"Check if frequencies can be equal by removing at most one character."**

### Explanation of the Visuals:

#### üìä Chart 1: Character Frequencies

* **x ‚Üí 1 time**
* **y ‚Üí 2 times**
* **z ‚Üí 2 times**

This gives a frequency dictionary:
`{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 2}`

#### üìä Chart 2: Frequency of Frequencies

* **1 appears once** ‚Üí one character has frequency 1 (x)
* **2 appears twice** ‚Üí two characters have frequency 2 (y and z)

---

### üë£ Step-by-step Dry Run

**Goal:** Can we remove at most 1 character and make all remaining characters have the same frequency?

1. Current frequencies: \[1, 2, 2]
2. Remove one `'x'` ‚Üí we‚Äôre left with \[2, 2]
3. ‚úÖ All frequencies are equal ‚áí Return `True`.
