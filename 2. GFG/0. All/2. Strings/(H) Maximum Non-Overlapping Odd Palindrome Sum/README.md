## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to **find the maximum possible sum of the lengths** of any **two non-empty** and **non-overlapping** palindromic substrings of **odd length**.

Formally, choose any two substrings `s[i...j]` and `s[k...l]` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ j < k ≤ l ≤ s.size()`, both substrings are palindromes of odd length, and they do not overlap. Return the **maximum sum** of their lengths.

---

### Notes:

* A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
* A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
* Only **odd-length palindromes** are considered in this problem.

## Examples

**Example 1**

```
Input:  s = "xyabcbcz"
Output: 6
Explanation:
"aba" and "cbc" are non-overlapping odd-length palindromes.
Their lengths are 3 and 3 which gives the sum as 6.
```

**Example 2**

```
Input:  s = "gfgforgeeks"
Output: 4
Explanation:
"gfg" and "g" are non-overlapping odd-length palindromes.
Their lengths are 3 and 1 which gives the sum as 4.
```

---

## Constraints:

* $2 \leq s.size() \leq 10^5$

## **2. Text Explanation (Step-by-Step)**

The problem asks for the **maximum sum of lengths of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings** from a given string `s`.

### **Approach Overview**

We solve this using **Manacher’s Algorithm** to find all possible palindromic substrings in `O(n)` and then use prefix/suffix tracking to choose the best two that don’t overlap.

---

### **Step-by-Step**

#### **Step 1 – Manacher’s Algorithm (Odd Length Palindromes)**

* We compute an array `d1` where:

  * `d1[i]` = radius `k` of the longest odd-length palindrome centered at `i`.
  * Length of this palindrome is `2*k - 1`.
* This allows **instant O(1)** queries of longest palindrome centered at any index.

---

#### **Step 2 – Storing Palindrome Info**

For each center `i`:

* Compute `start_i` = leftmost index of palindrome.
* Compute `end_i` = rightmost index of palindrome.
* Store `(start_i, center_i, end_i)`.

---

#### **Step 3 – `left_best_end` (Max palindrome ending at/before position `end`)**

* Sweep `end` from left to right.
* Maintain a **min-heap** of active palindromes covering the current `end`.
* `left_best_end[end]` = length of the largest palindrome ending at or before this index.

---

#### **Step 4 – `right_best_start` (Max palindrome starting at/after position `start`)**

* Sort palindromes by `start_i`.
* Sweep `start` from left to right.
* Maintain a **max-heap** to track the palindrome that starts at or after the current index.
* `right_best_start[start]` = length of the largest palindrome starting at or after this index.

---

#### **Step 5 – Prefix/Suffix Max Arrays**

* `left_max[i]` = max palindrome length from start to index `i`.
* `right_max[i]` = max palindrome length from index `i` to end.

---

#### **Step 6 – Combine for Best Split**

* For each possible cut between `cut` and `cut+1`:

  * Compute `left_max[cut] + right_max[cut+1]`.
* Keep the maximum sum.

---

### **Dry Run Example**

`s = "abacdfgdcaba"`

1. Manacher finds:

   * Palindrome at center 1: "aba" (len=3)
   * Palindrome at center 10: "aba" (len=3)
2. Prefix (`left_max`) and Suffix (`right_max`) arrays store the best palindromes possible.
3. Best cut might be after index 2:

   * Left: "aba" (len=3)
   * Right: "aba" (len=3)
   * Sum = 6

                k += 1
            d1[i] = k
            if i + k - 1 > r:
                l = i - k + 1
                r = i + k - 1

        centers = [(i - d1[i] + 1, i, i + d1[i] - 1) for i in range(n)]

        left_best_end = [0] * n
        heap = []

            while heap and heap[0][1] < end:
                heapq.heappop(heap)

                left_best_end[end] = 2 * (end - min_i) + 1

        for start in range(n):
            while idx < n and centers_by_start[idx][0] <= start:

                right_best_start[start] = 2 * (max_i - start) + 1

        # --- Step 5: Prefix/Suffix max ---
        left_max = [0] * n
        left_max[0] = left_best_end[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            left_max[i] = max(left_max[i - 1], left_best_end[i])

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            right_max[i] = max(right_max[i + 1], right_best_start[i])

        # --- Step 6: Combine ---
        ans = 0
        for cut in range(n - 1):
            ans = max(ans, left_max[cut] + right_max[cut + 1])

        return ans
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (Manacher + sweeps)
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (arrays for palindrome info)

## **4. Interview Q\&A**

**Q1:** Why use Manacher’s algorithm instead of expanding around centers?
**A:** Manacher’s is `O(n)`, while expanding around centers is `O(n^2)`. For large strings, this is crucial.

**Q2:** How do you ensure palindromes are non-overlapping?
**A:** By maintaining separate `left_max` and `right_max` arrays and cutting between indices.

**Q3:** Could this handle even-length palindromes?
**A:** Yes, but here only odd lengths are considered. You could adapt Manacher to handle both odd and even cases.

**Q4:** Why heaps are used?
**A:** They help track the best palindrome covering the current position efficiently during sweeps.

Perfect—here’s a **complete, runnable Python program** that implements the **accepted GFG solution** (Manacher + two heap sweeps), includes **inline time/space complexity notes**, prints **input & output**, and uses **`timeit`** to benchmark the full run in `main`.

It supports:

* Reading the string from a file (default: `fileInput.txt` in the current folder), or
* Reading from standard input if you pass `--stdin`.

Maximum Non-Overlapping Odd Palindrome Sum
------------------------------------------
Given a string s, find the maximum sum of lengths of two non-overlapping odd-length palindromic substrings.

Approach (GFG-accepted):
1) Manacher's (odd) in O(n) time to get the longest odd palindrome centered at each index.
2) Convert to triples (start, center, end).
3) Sweep for the best palindrome ending at/before each position (prefix side) using a min-heap -> left_best_end.
4) Sweep for the best palindrome starting at/after each position (suffix side) using a max-heap -> right_best_start.
5) Prefix/suffix maxima and combine over all cuts.

Overall Complexity:
- Time:  O(n) (Manacher) + O(n log n) (two heap sweeps) + O(n) (prefix/suffix & combine) = O(n log n)
- Space: O(n) for arrays and heaps

* **Using a specific path:**

  ```bash
  python3 max_sum_pal_split.py /path/to/your/file.txt
  ```
* **Piping from stdin:**

  ```bash
  cat fileInput.txt | python3 max_sum_pal_split.py --stdin

You’ll see:

* The input length & preview,
* The **computed maximum sum** (e.g., `6606` for your provided file),

Here are a few **high-impact real-world use cases** where the logic behind this **“maximum sum of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings”** problem applies:

---

### **1. DNA / RNA Sequence Analysis**

### **2. Data Compression & Pattern Mining**

* Many compression algorithms (e.g., Lempel–Ziv family) exploit repeated or symmetric patterns.
* Locating **two largest non-overlapping palindromes** can help in **dictionary-based encoding** or **palindrome-based redundancy reduction**.

---

### **3. Cybersecurity & Malware Signature Detection**

* Certain malware uses **palindromic or mirrored byte sequences** to evade pattern-based detection.
* Detecting the **two largest non-overlapping palindromic subsequences** in binary strings can help in **signature generation** for security tools.

---

### **4. Text Pattern Matching in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

* In cryptography, NLP, or steganography, **palindromic patterns** in text may indicate hidden markers.
* This problem’s algorithm helps extract **two significant non-overlapping palindromes** for **information retrieval** or **message decoding**.
