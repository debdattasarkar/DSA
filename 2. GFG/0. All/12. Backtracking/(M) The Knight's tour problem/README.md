## üß© Problem Statement

You are given an **n √ó n chessboard** with a **Knight** starting at the top-left corner **(0, 0)**.
Your task is to determine a **valid Knight's Tour**, where the Knight visits **every square exactly once**, following the standard movement rules of a chess Knight.

You have to return the **order in which each cell is visited**.
If a solution exists, print the sequence of numbers representing the order of visited squares.
If no solution is possible, **return -1**.

> **Note:**
> You can return any valid ordering. If it is correct, the driver code will print `true`, else it will print `false`.

---

## üß† Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
n = 5
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

**Explanation:**
A possible Knight's Tour in a 5√ó5 chessboard is given below where each number represents the step at which the Knight visits that cell, starting from (0, 0) as step 0.

```
[[0, 11,  2, 17, 20],
 [3, 16, 19, 12,  7],
 [10,  1,  6, 21, 18],
 [15,  4, 23,  8, 13],
 [24,  9, 14,  5, 22]]
```

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
n = 4
```

**Output:**

```
true
```

**Explanation:**
For n = 4, it is **not possible** for a valid Knight's Tour,
so you have to **return -1**.

## 2) Intuition + Step-by-Step Dry Run

### Goal

* On an `n √ó n` chessboard, start at `(0,0)`.
* Visit **every square exactly once** using knight moves.
* Return the **visit-order matrix** (`0 ‚Ä¶ n¬≤‚àí1`) if a tour exists; otherwise return **`[[-1]]`** (because the driver checks exactly for a 1√ó1 `[-1]` matrix).

### Facts to remember (used for fast exits)

* Tour **exists** for `n = 1` and **all `n ‚â• 5`**.
* **No tour** for `n ‚àà {2,3,4}`.
* We‚Äôll still keep a backtracking search for safety and to produce an actual tour.

### Core idea

* This is a Hamiltonian path problem on the ‚Äúknight-move graph‚Äù.
* Use **backtracking**: place step `k` on a square, try legal next moves for step `k+1`, backtrack on dead ends.
* Speed it up with **Warnsdorff‚Äôs heuristic**: from the current square, try next squares in the order of **fewest onward legal moves** first (i.e., least-constraining).

### Dry run (first moves, `n = 5`)

We‚Äôll sketch the **Warnsdorff** ordering from `(0,0)`.

1. **Step 0** at `(0,0)` ‚Üí mark board[0][0] = 0.
   Legal moves: `(2,1)` and `(1,2)`.
   Compute **onward degree** for both (how many unvisited legal moves from there). Suppose they tie; we pick lexicographically `(1,2)` first.

2. **Step 1** at `(1,2)`.
   Generate its legal unvisited neighbors and sort them by onward degree: e.g., candidates might be `(3,3)`, `(3,1)`, `(2,4)`, `(0,4)`, `(2,0)`, `(0,0-visited)`.
   Choose the one with the **fewest onward options**, say `(3,3)`.

3. **Step 2** at `(3,3)`.
   Again, generate & sort next moves by onward degree, take the smallest.

‚Ä¶ Continue.

* If at some point **no candidates** and we‚Äôve **not** filled all `25` cells ‚Üí **backtrack** to previous step and try the next candidate.
* For `n = 5` this typically fills all cells quickly.
* For `n = 2/3/4`, we never even search ‚Äî we immediately return `[[-1]]`.

## 3) Python Solutions (interview-ready)

          ‚Ä¢ Classic results: tour exists for n=1 and all n>=5; none for n in {2,3,4}.

> In interviews, mention you‚Äôd **prefer Warnsdorff** because it prunes dramatically by visiting tight squares early.

---

## 4) Interview Q&A (high-yield)

**Q1. Why do we return `[[-1]]` instead of `-1`?**
Because some drivers (like the one you‚Äôre using) **check specifically** for a **1√ó1 matrix `[-1]`** to mark ‚Äúno solution‚Äù. Returning int `-1` would cause their post-processing to crash (`len(-1)`).

**Q2. When is a Knight‚Äôs Tour possible?**
Classic result: **possible** for `n = 1` and **all `n ‚â• 5`**; **not possible** for `n ‚àà {2,3,4}`. (We still keep search for safety and to construct the actual tour.)

**Q3. What is Warnsdorff‚Äôs heuristic and why does it help?**
At each step, choose the next square with the **fewest onward legal moves**. This **reduces branching** and leads to a solution quickly in practice.

**Q4. Complexity?**

* **Backtracking** worst-case is exponential (`~ 8^(n¬≤)` upper bound).
* With **Warnsdorff**, it‚Äôs still exponential in theory, but **very fast in practice** for small `n`.
* **Space** is `O(n¬≤)` for the board (and recursion depth up to `n¬≤`).

**Q5. How do you verify a returned tour?**

* Matrix contains exactly the integers **0 to n¬≤‚àí1** once each.
* For each `k` from 0 to n¬≤‚àí2, the cell of `k` is a **legal knight move** away from the cell of `k+1`.

**Q6. Can we start from a different square?**
Yes. The search works from any start, just set the initial `(x0,y0)` and `board[x0][y0] = 0`.

**Q7. Any further optimizations?**

* Precompute legal moves per cell to avoid recomputation.
* Tie-break Warnsdorff by preferring moves toward the board center (empirical).
* In systems languages, bitboards can speed things up drastically.

perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **runnable, interview-style full program** that:

* implements the exact signature `class Solution: def knightTour(self, n): ...`
  (returns an `n√ón` visit-order matrix or **`[[-1]]`** when impossible ‚Äî driver-safe)
* also includes a plain backtracking variant for comparison
* prints **inputs & outputs** for a few values of `n`
* measures runtime with **`timeit`** and reports **average seconds/run**
* has **inline comments** calling out **time & space complexity** at each step

Knight's Tour ‚Äî Backtracking with Warnsdorff (driver-safe)
---------------------------------------------------------
We provide:
  ‚Ä¢ class Solution.knightTour(n)  -> main solution (Warnsdorff + backtracking)

      - returns [[-1]] if impossible (this shape avoids driver crashes)

Complexities

‚Ä¢ Warnsdorff heuristic: still exponential worst-case, but typically very fast for n ‚â§ 6.

### What you‚Äôll see when you run it

* For `n=1`: prints `[[0]]`, ‚ÄúValid tour? True‚Äù
* For `n=2`: prints `[[‚àí1]]` (as required)
* For `n=5` and `n=6`: prints a full valid tour matrix and ‚ÄúValid tour? True‚Äù
* Timing lines comparing **Warnsdorff** vs **Plain** backtracking

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (the very important ones)

1. **Path planning with hard constraints**
   The board can represent waypoints; knight moves encode feasible transitions. The tour models visiting all waypoints **exactly once** (e.g., inspection drones with limited maneuvering patterns).

2. **Hamiltonian path search in sparse geometric graphs**
   Knight‚Äôs tour is a canonical constrained Hamiltonian path problem; the techniques (heuristic ordering like Warnsdorff + backtracking) transfer to **PCB routing**, **maze generation**, and **graph puzzle solvers**.

3. **Testing & benchmarking backtracking/heuristics**
   Used widely in research/education to compare **ordering heuristics**, **pruning**, and **search strategies** in NP-complete contexts.
