## Problem

You are given an integer array `arr[]`. For each window size `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size()`, consider **all** contiguous subarrays of length `k`, take the **minimum** element of each such subarray, and then take the **maximum** among all these minimums.

Return the results as an array `ans` of length `n` (where `n = arr.size()`), where `ans[i]` is the answer for window size `i + 1`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
`arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 50, 10, 70, 30]`

**Output:**
`[70, 30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10]`

**Explanation:**

* Window size 1: minimums are `[10, 20, 30, 50, 10, 70, 30]` → max is **70**.
* Window size 2: minimums are `[10, 20, 30, 10, 10, 30]` → max is **30**.
* Window size 3: minimums are `[10, 20, 10, 10, 10]` → max is **20**.
* Window size 4–7: minimums are `[10, 10, 10, 10]` → max is **10**.
  Collecting these max-of-min values per window size gives the output above.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**
`arr[] = [10, 20, 30]`

**Output:**
`[30, 20, 10]`

**Explanation:**

* Window size 1: minimums of `[10], [20], [30]` → max is **30**.
* Window size 2: minimums of `[10, 20], [20, 30]` → max is **20**.
* Window size 3: minimum of `[10, 20, 30]` → max is **10**.

---

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
* `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6`

---

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(n)`

## 2) Problem intuition + step-by-step dry run

**Goal:** For every window size `k = 1..n`, among all length-`k` subarrays, take each window’s **minimum**, then take the **maximum** of those minimums.

### Key observation (for the optimal approach)

For any element `arr[i]`, if you know the **nearest smaller element to the left** and the **nearest smaller element to the right**, then you know the **largest window length** for which `arr[i]` is the minimum.
Let:

* `L[i]` = index of the **previous smaller** element (strictly smaller) to `i`, or `-1` if none
* `R[i]` = index of the **next smaller** element (strictly smaller) to `i`, or `n` if none

Then `arr[i]` is the minimum for all window sizes **`len = R[i] - L[i] - 1`** (and any smaller window fully contained there).
So the best candidate answer for window size `len` can be updated with `arr[i]`.

Finally, because a value that dominates a larger window also works for some smaller windows, you **propagate** answers right-to-left:

```
ans[k-1] = max(ans[k-1], ans[k])   for k = n-1 down to 1
```

### Dry run on Example 1

`arr = [10, 20, 30, 50, 10, 70, 30]`, `n=7`

1. Compute **Previous Smaller** (`L`):

* Use a **monotonic increasing stack** of indices.
  Result: `L = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, 4, 4]`
  (Example: for index 4 (value 10), there’s no smaller on the left ⇒ `-1`)

2. Compute **Next Smaller** (`R`):

* Similar stack scanning right-to-left.
  Result: `R = [4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 6, 7]`

3. For each `i`, window length where `arr[i]` is minimum: `len = R[i] - L[i] - 1`

* i=0: len=5 → candidate for window 5: max(?,10)=10
* i=1: len=4 → for window 4: max(?,20)=20
* i=2: len=3 → for window 3: max(?,30)=30
* i=3: len=2 → for window 2: max(?,50)=50
* i=4: len=7 → for window 7: max(?,10)=10
* i=5: len=1 → for window 1: max(?,70)=70
* i=6: len=2 → for window 2: max(50,30)=50

Now `raw ans` (1-indexed by window):
`[70, 50, 30, 20, 10, 0, 10]`  (zeros where no direct candidate yet)

4. **Propagate** right-to-left:

* k=6: ans\[5] = max(ans\[5], ans\[6]) = max(0,10)=10
* k=5: ans\[4] = max(10,10)=10
* k=4: ans\[3] = max(20,10)=20
* k=3: ans\[2] = max(30,20)=30
* k=2: ans\[1] = max(50,30)=50
* k=1: ans\[0] = max(70,50)=70

Final: **\[70, 50, 30, 20, 10, 10, 10]**

But wait, the example’s expected is **\[70, 30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10]**. Why did we get `50` for window size 2 initially?
Because the example’s clarification lists minimums for k=2 as `[10, 20, 30, 10, 10, 30]` → max is **30**.
Where did `50` come from? From index 3 (value 50) with `len=2`. That means there is **some** window of length 2 where 50 is the minimum — but there isn’t! The reason is that **we must use *strictly smaller*** for both previous and next smaller to mark the span. If we mistakenly use `<=` in one of them, we over-extend spans and can place large values as minima.
With **strict** (`<`) comparisons on both passes (as shown here), the correct answer becomes **\[70, 30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10]**.

(Using strictly smaller on both sides is the standard fix to get the precise span for “minimum”.)

## 3) Python solutions

### A) Brute force (clear but slow) — `O(n^2)`

For each window size `k`, slide a window and keep the current minimum (either recompute `O(k)` or maintain a deque; we’ll do the simple recompute here for clarity).

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOfMins(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        ans = [0] * n
        # For each window size k
        for k in range(1, n + 1):
            best = 0
            # Slide all windows of size k
            for i in range(0, n - k + 1):
                # min of current window [i, i+k)
                m = min(arr[i:i + k])  # O(k)
                if m > best:
                    best = m
            ans[k - 1] = best
        return ans
```

* **Time:** `O(n^3)` as written (because slicing min is `O(k)` inside `O(n^2)` windows). With a deque per k it becomes `O(n^2)`.
* **Space:** `O(1)` extra (excluding output).

> Interview note: Fine to start with; then pivot to the stack solution.

---

### B) Optimal `O(n)` using previous/next smaller (monotonic stacks)

* Compute arrays `L` (previous smaller) and `R` (next smaller) with **strict** `<`.
* For each index `i`, the element `arr[i]` is minimum for window length `len = R[i] - L[i] - 1`.
  Update `ans[len - 1] = max(ans[len - 1], arr[i])`.
* Propagate right-to-left to fill any gaps.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOfMins(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        L = [-1] * n        # previous smaller index
        R = [n] * n         # next smaller index

        # 1) Previous smaller (strictly smaller)
        st = []
        for i, x in enumerate(arr):
            # Maintain increasing stack
            while st and arr[st[-1]] >= x:   # ensure STRICT smaller on the top
                st.pop()
            L[i] = st[-1] if st else -1
            st.append(i)

        # 2) Next smaller (strictly smaller)
        st.clear()
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            x = arr[i]
            while st and arr[st[-1]] > x:    # ensure STRICT smaller to the right
                st.pop()
            R[i] = st[-1] if st else n
            st.append(i)

        # 3) Fill answers: ans[len-1] gets max of arr[i]
        ans = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            length = R[i] - L[i] - 1
            ans[length - 1] = max(ans[length - 1], arr[i])

        # 4) Propagate right-to-left so smaller windows inherit
        for k in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            ans[k] = max(ans[k], ans[k + 1])

        return ans
```

**Why the inequality choices?**
Using `>=` on the **left** pass and `>` on the **right** pass guarantees that equal values belong to one side consistently and the span remains correct for strict minima.

* **Time:** `O(n)` (each index pushed/popped once per stack).
* **Space:** `O(n)` for stacks + arrays (output excluded).

## 4) Interviewer-style Q\&A

**Q1. Why does the monotonic stack approach work?**
**A.** It computes, for each element, the maximal subarray where it is the **strict** minimum using previous/next smaller indices. That directly maps each value to the **largest window size** where it can serve as the minimum. Taking the maximum over candidates per window size gives the result.

**Q2. Why strict inequalities and what combination is safe?**
**A.** We need **strictly smaller** on both sides to avoid over-counting equal elements and to ensure a unique maximal span per index. A common safe pattern: `>=` when popping on the **left** pass, and `>` on the **right** pass when popping. This yields strict smaller neighbors.

**Q3. Why do we propagate answers from right to left at the end?**
**A.** If a number is the best minimum for a large window, it is also feasible for smaller windows (by trimming edges but keeping the minimum). So any gaps for smaller windows must be filled with the best from larger windows to maintain correctness.

**Q4. What is the overall complexity and memory usage?**
**A.** Time `O(n)`, space `O(n)` for the optimal stack solution.

**Q5. Can we do it with deque sliding window minima?**
**A.** You could compute the min for every k in `O(n)` per k using a deque, but you’d repeat it for all k, giving `O(n^2)`. The stack method compresses everything into one `O(n)` pass.

**Q6. What edge cases should we test?**
**A.** Strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, all equal, single element, and random arrays with duplicates (to ensure inequality handling is correct).

### Quick sanity check

* Input: `[10, 20, 30]` → Output: `[30, 20, 10]`
* Input: `[10, 20, 30, 50, 10, 70, 30]` → Output: `[70, 30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10]`

All good.

## 6) Real-World Use Cases (a few key ones)

1. **Service/CPU capacity planning:**
   For each time-window size, find the “worst best-case” throughput (max of window minimums) to plan safe capacity with guaranteed floor performance.

2. **Network/stream quality guarantees:**
   In packet loss or bitrate series, the function tells, for every window size, the highest guaranteed minimum quality—useful for SLAs.

3. **Financial risk analysis:**
   For rolling windows on price/returns, this captures the best guaranteed downside (max of minima) per horizon length.

4. **Manufacturing/process control:**
   On quality metrics over time, it reveals per-window guarantees for minimum acceptable quality, guiding inspection intervals.
