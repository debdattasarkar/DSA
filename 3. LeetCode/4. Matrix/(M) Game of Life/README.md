# 289. Game of Life

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topics:** Array, Matrix, Simulation
**Companies Asked In:** Common in simulations and system modeling interviews

---

According to [Wikipedia‚Äôs article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):

> The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

---

## Problem Statement

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state:

* `1` ‚Üí **Live**
* `0` ‚Üí **Dead**

Each cell interacts with its **eight neighbors** (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors **dies**, as if by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors **lives** on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors **dies**, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors **becomes a live cell**, as if by reproduction.

> All cells update **simultaneously** using the above rules.

---

### Goal

Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, **update the board in-place** to reflect its **next state**.

üìù *Note:* You do not need to return anything.

---

## Example 1

```
Input:
board = [
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]

Output:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

---

## Example 2

```
Input:
board = [
  [1,1],
  [1,0]
]

Output:
[
  [1,1],
  [1,1]
]
```

---

## Constraints

* `m == board.length`
* `n == board[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 25`
* `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`

---

## Follow-up

* Could you solve it **in-place**?

  > The board needs to be updated simultaneously:
  > You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.

* How would you model an **infinite board** using a 2D array?

  > The board is theoretically infinite. How would you handle active cells near the borders?

## ‚úÖ 1. Text Explanation + Step-by-Step Dry Run

### **Problem Summary**:

You are given a 2D grid of `0`s (dead) and `1`s (alive). Update the board in-place according to these rules **simultaneously** for each cell:

* **< 2** live neighbors ‚Üí dies (underpopulation)
* **2 or 3** live neighbors ‚Üí lives (stable)
* **> 3** live neighbors ‚Üí dies (overpopulation)
* **== 3** live neighbors ‚Üí becomes alive (reproduction)

> To do this **in-place**, we use **state encoding** to remember previous values.

---

### **State Encoding Strategy (for O(1) space)**:

We encode transitions:

* `0 ‚Üí 1`: Dead ‚Üí Live ‚Üí **mark as `2`**
* `1 ‚Üí 0`: Live ‚Üí Dead ‚Üí **mark as `-1`**

Then in a **second pass**, we finalize:

* `2` ‚Üí `1`
* `-1` ‚Üí `0`

---

### **Step-by-Step Dry Run**

#### Input:

```
board = [
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
```

#### Count Neighbors at (1,1):

* Neighbors: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
* Values: 0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1 ‚Üí **Total = 5**
* Current = 0 ‚Üí Dead ‚Üí Not becoming alive ‚Üí Stay 0

Continue similarly for all cells...

## ‚úÖ 3. Expected Interview Q\&A

**Q1.** How do you update the board in-place without using extra space?
**A:** Use temporary encodings:

* `1 ‚Üí 0` becomes `-1`
* `0 ‚Üí 1` becomes `2`
  And then finalize in a second pass.

---

**Q2.** Why can't we just directly update values?
**A:** Because all updates must happen **simultaneously**. Early updates affect neighbor calculations. Temporary states solve this.

---

**Q3.** What's the space and time complexity?

* **Time:** O(m √ó n)
* **Space:** O(1) (excluding input), due to in-place updates.

---

**Q4.** How do you handle boundaries in the grid?
**A:** Check bounds while visiting neighbors (`0 <= r < rows`, `0 <= c < cols`).

---

**Q5.** Can this be extended to an infinite board?
**A:** Use a hash set or sparse map for live cells only. Model only live/neighboring cells to avoid full infinite representation.
