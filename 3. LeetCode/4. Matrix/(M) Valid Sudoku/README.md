## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each **row** must contain the digits `1â€“9` **without repetition**.
2. Each **column** must contain the digits `1â€“9` **without repetition**.
3. Each of the **nine 3 Ã— 3** sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1â€“9` **without repetition**.

> **Note:**
>
> * A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
> * Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## ðŸ”¢ Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input:
board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: true
```

### Example 2:

```
Input:
board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: false

Explanation:
Same as Example 1, except the `5` in the top left corner is replaced by `8`.
This causes two `8`s in the top-left 3x3 sub-box, which violates the rule.
```

---

## ðŸ§¾ Constraints

* `board.length == 9`
* `board[i].length == 9`
* `board[i][j]` is a digit `1â€“9` or `'.'`

---

## ðŸ§  Approach Summary

We check three conditions for each cell:

1. Is the value repeated in the **same row**?
2. Is the value repeated in the **same column**?
3. Is the value repeated in the **same 3x3 sub-grid**?

We can track this using three sets (or hash maps):

* One for rows,
* One for columns,
* One for 3x3 boxes (indexed by `i//3, j//3`).

If any condition fails, the board is **invalid**.

### âœ… Problem: 36. Valid Sudoku

You are given a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board. The task is to **determine if it is valid**, meaning it obeys these rules:

### âœ… Rules:

1. Each row must contain digits **1â€“9** **without repetition**.
2. Each column must contain digits **1â€“9** **without repetition**.
3. Each of the 3Ã—3 sub-boxes must also contain digits **1â€“9** **without repetition**.

> Empty cells are denoted as `"."`.

### ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Explanation & Dry Run:

#### Input:

```python
board = [
 ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
```

#### Dry Run:

* Loop through each row:

  * Store digits in a set.
  * If a digit appears again â†’ return False.
* Loop through each column:

  * Same as above.
* Loop through each 3x3 box (top-left corners: (0,0), (0,3), (0,6), ..., (6,6)):

  * Check 3x3 window for duplicates.

âœ… No duplicates found â†’ return True.

## ðŸ’¬ Expected Interview Q\&A:

**Q1: What is the time complexity?**

* **O(1)** â†’ Because the grid is fixed size (9x9), even if you check every cell, it's constant time.

**Q2: What data structure is used?**

* Sets for fast duplicate detection.

**Q3: How are the 3x3 boxes indexed?**

* Box index = `(i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)` to flatten 3x3 grids into index 0â€“8.

**Q4: What is the space complexity?**

* **O(1)** constant space, since max size is fixed.

**Q5: Why don't we care about empty cells?**

* Because the problem only validates filled cells.
