### ✅ Python Code with Inline Comments, Time & Space Complexity, and I/O

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Create a set of all unique numbers for O(1) lookups
        num_set = set(nums)  # Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

        max_len = 0  # Track the maximum sequence length

        # Step 2: Iterate through each number
        for num in num_set:
            # Only start counting if `num` is the start of a sequence
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current = num
                streak = 1

                # Step 3: Increment `current` to check for next numbers in sequence
                while current + 1 in num_set:
                    current += 1
                    streak += 1  # Increase sequence length

                # Step 4: Update the global max length
                max_len = max(max_len, streak)

        return max_len  # Final result
```

### 📊 Time and Space Complexity Breakdown

| Step                         | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `set(nums)` creation         | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| Iteration & inner while loop | O(n) total      | O(1) per element |
| Total                        | ✅ **O(n)**      | ✅ **O(n)**       |

> **Why O(n)** time? Each number is visited at most twice — once when checking if it's the start, and potentially once while extending the streak.

### 🧪 Example Inputs & Outputs

#### Input:

```python
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
```

#### Output:

```python
4
```

#### Explanation:

* The longest consecutive sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
* So, the function returns `4`.

---

### 🔁 Another Dry Run

```python
nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]

Set = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

→ Start at 0 (since -1 not in set)
    → 1, 2, ..., 8 (streak = 9)
→ Max = 9
```

---

### ✅ Summary

* Works in **O(n)** time.
* No sorting required.
* Efficient use of `set` for lookups and uniqueness.
* Great for interviews when asked to optimize linear time sequence problems.

### 📘 Full Python Code with Inline Comments

```python
from typing import List
import timeit

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Convert input list to a set for O(1) lookups
        num_set = set(nums)  # Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
        max_len = 0  # Store the length of the longest consecutive sequence

        # Step 2: Loop through each unique number in the set
        for num in num_set:
            # Start of a new sequence if previous number doesn't exist
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current = num
                streak = 1

                # Step 3: Expand the streak forward
                while current + 1 in num_set:
                    current += 1
                    streak += 1

                # Step 4: Update max length found
                max_len = max(max_len, streak)

        return max_len

### ⌛ Timeit Performance Test

```python
# Test input
input_data = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
solution = Solution()
print("Output:", solution.longestConsecutive(input_data))  # Expected: 4

# Performance check using timeit
def run_solution():
    solution.longestConsecutive(input_data)

execution_time = timeit.timeit(run_solution, number=1000)
print("Execution time for 1000 runs:", execution_time)
```

### 📈 Performance Breakdown

| Step                    | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Reason                                        |

| Converting to set       | O(n)            | O(n)             | For fast lookup                               |
| Main loop and expansion | O(n)            | —                | Each element visited once at most in sequence |
| Overall                 | ✅ **O(n)**      | ✅ **O(n)**       | Meets linear time requirement                 |
