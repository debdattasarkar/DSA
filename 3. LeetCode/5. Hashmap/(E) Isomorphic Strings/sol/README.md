| Step                           | Time      | Space      | Explanation                                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `zip(s, t)` iteration          | O(n)      | -          | Loop through both strings once                     |
| Dictionary lookups and inserts | O(1) each | O(1) total | Up to 256 unique ASCII characters â†’ constant space |

## ðŸ§ª Sample Inputs and Outputs

### ðŸ”¹ Example 1

```python
s = "egg"
t = "add"
print(Solution().isIsomorphic(s, t))  # Output: True
```

Explanation:

* 'e' â†’ 'a'
* 'g' â†’ 'd'

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 2

```python
s = "foo"
t = "bar"
print(Solution().isIsomorphic(s, t))  # Output: False
```

Explanation:

* 'o' is mapped to both 'a' and 'r' â†’ invalid mapping.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example 3

```python
s = "paper"
t = "title"
print(Solution().isIsomorphic(s, t))  # Output: True
```

Explanation:

* p â†’ t
* a â†’ i
* e â†’ l
* r â†’ e

## âœ… Summary

* **Core idea:** Use two hash maps (forward + reverse) to ensure bijective mapping.
* **Why both maps?** Prevent multiple keys mapping to the same value (injectivity check).
* **Efficient:** Single pass, constant space, works even with large strings (up to 50,000 chars).
