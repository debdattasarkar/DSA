# Predecessor and Successor

## Introduction

The **Predecessor and Successor** problem in a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** involves finding:

* The **in-order predecessor**: the largest value smaller than a given key.
* The **in-order successor**: the smallest value greater than a given key.

## Problem Statement

Given the **root node of a BST** and an **integer key**, return the **in-order predecessor** and **in-order successor** of the key.

* If the predecessor or successor does not exist, return `NULL` (i.e., `-1` in output).

> **Note:** In an in-order traversal, the number just **smaller** than the target is the **predecessor**, and the number just **greater** than the target is the **successor**.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [8, 1, 9, N, 4, N, 10, 3], key = 8
Output: 4 9

Explanation:
In-order traversal = [1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]
Predecessor of 8 is 4
Successor of 8 is 9
```

---

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [10, 2, 11, 1, 5, N, N, 3, 6, 4], key = 11
Output: 10 -1

Explanation:
In-order traversal = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11]
Predecessor of 11 is 10
Successor doesn't exist ‚Üí -1
```

---

### Example 3

```
Input: root = [2, 1, 3], key = 3
Output: 2 -1

Explanation:
Predecessor is 2
No successor exists
```

## Constraints

* `1 ‚â§ Number of nodes ‚â§ 10^5`
* `1 ‚â§ Node->data ‚â§ 10^6`
* `1 ‚â§ key ‚â§ 10^6`

## Expected Complexities

* **Time Complexity**: O(Height of the BST)
* **Auxiliary Space**: O(1)

## üß† Problem Summary

Given a **Binary Search Tree** and a **key**, find:

* The **inorder predecessor**: Largest value smaller than the key.
* The **inorder successor**: Smallest value greater than the key.

### Inorder Traversal Property in BST:

* In BST, the inorder traversal results in a **sorted array**.

---

## üîç Algorithm Explanation

### Step 1: Traverse the BST

* If `key == root.data`:

  * For predecessor: Go **left**, then as far **right** as possible.
  * For successor: Go **right**, then as far **left** as possible.
* If `key < root.data`:

  * Current node **might be successor**, go **left**.
* If `key > root.data`:

  * Current node **might be predecessor**, go **right**.

This ensures **O(h)** time complexity.

## üß™ Dry Run

### Tree:

```
       10
      /  \
     2    11
    / \
   1   5
      / \
     3   6
        /
       4
```

### Key = 11

* Predecessor = 10 (largest smaller)
* Successor = None ‚Üí -1
