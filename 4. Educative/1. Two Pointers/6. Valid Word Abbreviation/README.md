## ❓ Main Question: Valid Word Abbreviation

**Problem Statement**:
Given a string `word` and an abbreviation `abbr`, return `True` if the abbreviation correctly represents the word, otherwise return `False`.

---

### ✅ Abbreviation Rules

A valid abbreviation:

* Uses numbers to **skip letters** in the original word.
* Letters in `abbr` must match the **corresponding characters** in `word`.
* Numbers represent **how many characters to skip**.
* Numbers **cannot start with 0**.
* Skips must **not exceed** the word’s length.
* The entire `abbr` and `word` must be consumed by the end.

---

## 📌 Pointers to Remember

### 1. **Two Pointer Technique**

* Use one pointer `i` for `word`, one pointer `j` for `abbr`.
* Traverse both strings simultaneously.

---

### 2. **Digit Handling in `abbr`**

* If `abbr[j]` is a **digit**:

  * Build the full number (e.g., `12` not just `1`)
  * **Reject leading zeros** (e.g., `"01"` is invalid)
  * Increment `i` (pointer in `word`) by this number to skip characters.

---

### 3. **Character Handling**

* If `abbr[j]` is a **letter**:

  * Check if it matches `word[i]`
  * If yes, move both pointers forward.
  * If no, return `False`.

---

### 4. **Final Validation**

* At the end, both `i` (word) and `j` (abbr) must reach the end.
* If either does not, return `False`.

---

## ✅ Example

**Input**:

* `word = "innovation"`
* `abbr = "in7n"`

**Output**:

* `True`
  Explanation: `in[7 skipped characters]n` matches the original word.

---

## 🚫 Invalid Examples

* `"a01"` — leading zero → ❌
* `"ab"` for `"a"` — abbreviation is longer than word → ❌
* `"word"` vs `"4d"` — trying to skip entire word plus mismatch → ❌

---

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time**: `O(n)` — scan both strings once
* **Space**: `O(1)` — constant space, no extra data structures

---

## ✅ Valid Word Abbreviation — Two-Pointer Strategy

### 🧠 Objective:

Check if the abbreviation `abbr` correctly represents the full word `word`, using digit-based skipping and letter matching.

---

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Logic

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**

   * Set both pointers to `0`:

     * One for `word`
     * One for `abbr`

2. **Traverse the Abbreviation**

   * Iterate through `abbr` until the abbreviation pointer reaches its end.

3. **Handle Digits in `abbr`**

   * If the current character in `abbr` is a digit:

     * Ensure it is **not a leading zero**
     * Read the full numeric sequence (e.g., `23`)
     * **Skip that many characters** in `word` by incrementing the word pointer

4. **Handle Letters in `abbr`**

   * If the character is a letter:

     * Match it with the corresponding character in `word`
     * If mismatch → return `False`

5. **Repeat Until Completion or Mismatch**

   * Continue steps 3 and 4 until:

     * A mismatch occurs
     * Or the abbreviation is fully parsed

6. **Final Check**

   * If both pointers reach the end of their respective strings:

     * ✅ Return `True`
   * Else:

     * ❌ Return `False`

Here are the **pointers to remember** from the **"Valid Word Abbreviation"** solution breakdown:

## ✅ Key Interview Pointers — Valid Word Abbreviation

### 📌 Problem Understanding

* You must validate if `abbr` is a correct abbreviation of the string `word`.
* Digits in `abbr` represent the count of characters skipped in `word`.

---

## 🧠 Must-Know Concepts

### 1. **Use Two Pointers**

* `word_index` → position in the `word`
* `abbr_index` → position in the `abbr`
* Traverse both simultaneously to validate abbreviation logic

---

### 2. **Handling Digits in `abbr`**

* If `abbr[abbr_index]` is a digit:

  * **Leading zero check** → not allowed (`"01"` is invalid)
  * Accumulate all consecutive digits to get the full number
  * Advance `word_index` by that number (skip characters)

---

### 3. **Handling Letters**

* If `abbr[abbr_index]` is a letter:

  * It must match `word[word_index]`
  * Else return `False`
  * If it matches, increment both pointers

---

### 4. **Final Validation**

* After parsing, both `word_index` and `abbr_index` should reach their string ends
* If not → return `False`

---

### 🧪 Example

**word** = `"substitute"`
**abbr** = `"s8e"`
✅ Explanation: Skip 8 characters between `'s'` and `'e'`

---

### ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time**: `O(n)`
  Traverses each character of `abbr` once
* **Space**: `O(1)`
  Only uses integer counters, no extra data structures

---

## 🚫 Invalid Abbreviations — Edge Case Traps

* `"s01e"` → ❌ leading zero
* `"s10"` → ❌ skip count exceeds length
* `"s8"` when only 8 characters follow `'s'` → ✅
