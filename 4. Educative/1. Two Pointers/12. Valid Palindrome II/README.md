The image you’ve shared corresponds to the problem: **"Valid Palindrome II"**, which is about checking if a string can be a palindrome by removing **at most one character**.

## ✅ Problem: Valid Palindrome II

### Statement

Write a function to determine if the input string can be made a palindrome by removing **at most one character**.

---

## 🧠 Strategy: Two Pointer Technique

### Key Idea:

Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to scan from both ends. When a mismatch occurs:

* Try skipping either the left or right character.
* Check if the resulting substring is a palindrome.

## 💡 Dry Run Example

```txt
Input: "abcbea"
        l   ^   r
Mismatch: b ≠ e
Try:
- Removing 'b' → check "acea" ❌
- Removing 'e' → check "abca" ❌
→ Not valid palindrome

Input: "abccba" ✅ already palindrome

Input: "abca"
        l ^ ^   r
Mismatch at b ≠ c
Try:
- Remove 'b': check "aca" ✅ → Valid!
```

### Steps:

---

### Drag and drop the cards to rearrange them in the correct sequence.

1. ✅ **Initialize two pointers at opposite ends of the string.**

2. ✅ **If the values at the left and right indexes match, move both toward the middle until they meet.**

3. ✅ **If a mismatch occurs, skip one of the elements from either the left or right side and check the rest of the string for a palindrome.**

4. ✅ **Skip the element from the other side, and check for the palindrome.**

5. ✅ **If no palindrome is obtained, return False; else if no more than one mismatch occurs throughout the traversal, return True.**

## ⏱ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n)` — one full pass and possibly two substring checks.
* **Space:** `O(n)` (for slicing); can be reduced to `O(1)` if checking manually without slicing.

---

## 🧪 Constraints

* `1 <= string.length <= 10⁵`
* Contains **only English letters**
