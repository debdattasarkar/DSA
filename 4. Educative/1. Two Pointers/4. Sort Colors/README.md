Here are the **main question and interview-crucial pointers** based on the screenshot for the **Sort Colors** problem (also known as the **Dutch National Flag problem**):

## ❓ Main Question: Sort Colors

**Problem Statement**:
Given an array `colors` where each element is:

* `0` → red
* `1` → white
* `2` → blue

Sort the array **in-place** so that all:

* `0`s (red) come first,
* followed by `1`s (white),
* and `2`s (blue) at the end.

> 🚫 You are **not allowed to use built-in sorting**. The goal is an efficient in-place sort with constant extra space.

---

## 📌 Constraints

* `1 ≤ colors.length ≤ 300`
* `colors[i] ∈ {0, 1, 2}`

---

## 🧠 Key Pointers for Interviews

### 1. **Dutch National Flag Algorithm**

* Use **three pointers**:

  * `low`: boundary for 0s (start of array)
  * `mid`: current index being evaluated
  * `high`: boundary for 2s (end of array)

### 2. **Single Pass In-Place Sort Logic**

* Traverse using `mid`, and depending on value:

  * If `colors[mid] == 0`:
    Swap with `colors[low]`, then increment both `low` and `mid`.
  * If `colors[mid] == 1`:
    Leave it in place, just `mid += 1`.
  * If `colors[mid] == 2`:
    Swap with `colors[high]`, then decrement `high` (do not move `mid` yet).

### 3. **Efficient and Optimal**

* ✅ One-pass
* ✅ Constant space: `O(1)`
* ✅ Time: `O(n)`

---

## ✅ Example

**Input**: `[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`
**Output**: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`

---

## 🔄 Process Flow Summary

1. Initialize pointers `low = 0`, `mid = 0`, `high = n - 1`
2. Loop until `mid > high`
3. Swap and move boundaries as described
4. Finish when all values are partitioned correctly

Here are the **most important pointers** to remember from the "Sort Colors" problem solution, especially for **technical interviews**:

## ✅ Problem Summary: Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Problem)

**Task**:
Sort an array containing only `0`, `1`, and `2` in-place (no extra memory) so that:

* All `0`s (red) come first
* Then `1`s (white)
* Then `2`s (blue)

> 🚫 You **cannot use built-in sorting functions**. Must solve in **one pass with O(1) extra space**.

## 📌 Key Interview Pointers

### 1. **Three Pointers (Two Boundaries + Current)**

* `start`: Boundary between 0s and 1s
* `end`: Boundary between 2s and unknowns
* `current`: Active index being evaluated

### 2. **Core Logic Based on `colors[current]`**:

* `0`:
  Swap `colors[current]` with `colors[start]`, then `start += 1`, `current += 1`
* `1`:
  Just `current += 1`
* `2`:
  Swap `colors[current]` with `colors[end]`, then `end -= 1`, (do **not** increment `current` yet!)

### 3. **One-Pass Solution**

* Traverse array **only once**, making swaps as needed.
* All color groups are expanded dynamically as `start`, `current`, and `end` shift.

---

## 🧠 Important Observations

* This is a **partitioning algorithm** similar to QuickSort.
* You avoid sorting overhead by **positioning elements during traversal**.
* No count arrays, no extra space — it's optimal and elegant.
* Blue (`2`) handling is tricky — you recheck the element swapped from `end`.

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time**: `O(n)` — every element is visited at most once.
* **Space**: `O(1)` — constant space, in-place sorting.
