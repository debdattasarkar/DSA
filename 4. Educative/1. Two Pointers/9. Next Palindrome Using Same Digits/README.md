## 🔢 Problem: Next Palindrome Using Same Digits

### 🎯 Objective:

Given a numeric **palindrome** string, return the next **greater** palindrome that can be formed using **same digits**. If not possible, return an **empty string**.

---

### 🧠 Key Observations:

* Palindrome implies **mirror symmetry**.
* The **left half** (with middle digit if odd-length) determines the entire number.
* This becomes a **next permutation** problem applied to the **left half** of the string.

---

### ✅ Steps to Solve:

1. **Start from the middle**, scan left to find the **first digit** that violates the decreasing trend (rightmost "pivot").
2. If no such digit is found → return **""** (no larger permutation possible).
3. Otherwise, find the **smallest digit to the right** of the pivot that is **greater than** the pivot and swap them.
4. **Reverse the suffix** (digits to the right of the pivot) to get the next smallest number.
5. **Mirror the left half** (including middle if odd) to construct the **next palindrome**.
6. Return the new palindrome only if it is **greater than the input**.

---

### 💡 Example:

Input: `"1234321"`
→ Valid next palindromes: `"1243421"`, `"1324231"`, ...
→ Output: `"1324231"`

---

### 🧮 Time Complexity:

* `O(n)` for scanning and mirroring.

### 🗂 Space Complexity:

* `O(n)` for creating the result string.

## ✅ Final Summary: Next Palindrome Using Same Digits

### 🧩 Problem:

Given a numeric string that is already a **palindrome**, return the next **lexicographically larger palindrome** using **the same digits**. If not possible, return `""`.

---

### 🛠️ Key Steps:

1. **Check Length**:

   * If the input length is ≤ 1, no larger palindrome possible ⇒ return `""`.

2. **Divide the Number**:

   * Split the number into a **left half** and **right half**.
   * If odd-length, keep the **middle digit** separate.

3. **Find Next Permutation of Left Half**:

   * Use the two-pointer approach to find the **first decreasing point** from the end.
   * Find the next greater digit and **swap**.
   * Reverse the remaining part to get the **smallest lexicographic permutation**.

4. **Rebuild the Palindrome**:

   * If even length: mirror the new left half.
   * If odd length: place middle digit in between mirrored halves.

5. **Compare with Original**:

   * If the new palindrome is **greater** than the input, return it.
   * Else, return `""`.

---

### 💡 Why it works:

You’re only **rearranging the left half**, then **mirroring** to form the smallest next palindrome.

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:

* `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string.

### 🧠 Space Complexity:

* `O(n)` for storing parts of the number (left half, result, etc.).
