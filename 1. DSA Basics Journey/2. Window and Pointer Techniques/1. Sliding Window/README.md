Absolutely! Let‚Äôs dive deep into the **Sliding Window Technique**, one of the most commonly used techniques for solving problems involving **arrays and strings**, especially when you're dealing with **subarrays or substrings**.

---

## ü™ü What is the Sliding Window Technique?

### üìå Definition:

A **sliding window** is a **subrange** (window) within an array/string that moves from left to right, one element at a time. This technique is used to **avoid unnecessary recomputation** and **optimize time complexity**, especially in problems involving contiguous sequences.

---

## üß† When to Use It?

You should consider using a **sliding window** when the problem involves:

| Keyword                       | Use Sliding Window? |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Subarray / Substring          | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Fixed or variable window size | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Max / Min / Sum / Count       | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Contiguous elements           | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Repeated / unique elements    | ‚úÖ Yes               |

---

## üß© Two Types of Sliding Window

### ‚úÖ 1. **Fixed-Size Window**

Used when the window size is **known/fixed** (e.g., k elements).

**Example:**
Find max sum of any subarray of size `k`.

```python
def max_sum_k_subarray(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(k, n):
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum
```

**Time:** `O(n)`
**Space:** `O(1)`

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Variable-Size Window**

Used when the window size **changes dynamically** to meet a condition.

**Example:**
Find the length of the **longest substring without repeating characters**.

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    char_set = set()
    left = max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

**Time:** `O(n)`
**Space:** `O(k)` where k is alphabet size

## üß† Tips for Interview Success

* Maintain a **running sum/frequency/count** inside the window
* Use **2 pointers** (`left`, `right`) to define window
* Always try to:

  * **Expand** the window to meet condition
  * **Shrink** window to **optimize** or **enforce** condition

## üîÑ Patterns Based on Variants

| Pattern                   | Use When...                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Expand/shrink window      | Variable condition must be enforced          |
| Fixed window (k elements) | Subarray of known size needed                |
| Hashmap inside window     | Frequencies, anagrams, or character tracking |
| Counter or sliding sum    | Sum-based window optimization                |
