The **Two Pointer Technique** is a powerful and versatile algorithmic pattern widely used in DSA problems. It uses **two indices (pointers)** that move through a data structure (typically arrays or strings) to reduce time complexity ‚Äî often from `O(n¬≤)` to `O(n)` or `O(n log n)`.

## üß† Concept

> Use **two pointers**, typically named `left` and `right`, to scan the array or string in a strategic way (from start & end, or both from start, etc.)

## üîß Common Patterns

| Pattern                       | Usage Example                          | Pointer Movement                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Opposite Direction            | Sorted array: find pair with given sum | Start from both ends, move inward               |
| Same Direction (Sliding)      | Longest substring, prefix matching     | Both start at beginning, move right             |
| Window Expansion/Shrinking    | Variable Sliding Window                | Expand right, shrink left                       |
| Nested Increment (Merge sort) | Merge two sorted arrays/lists          | Both pointers start at 0, advance on conditions |

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Code: Two Sum in Sorted Array

```python
def two_sum(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:
        total = arr[left] + arr[right]

        if total == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif total < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return [-1, -1]  # Not found
```

### ‚è± Time Complexity: `O(n)`

### üß† Space: `O(1)`

## üéØ When to Use Two Pointers?

Use when:

* The array is **sorted** (or can be sorted)
* You're **merging, matching, or comparing** from two ends
* You want to find **minimum/maximum condition** in a range
* You're trying to **maintain a window or segment** dynamically

---

## üß© Real-Life Applications

* Comparing **two time series logs** (merging events)
* Streaming **real-time data** and matching against a range
* Managing **interval overlaps** (e.g. meeting rooms)
* Finding optimal pairs (e.g. **price pairs ‚â§ budget**)
