Let's go through **Leetcode 42 ‚Äì Trapping Rain Water**, one of the most famous **Two Pointer** problems involving elevation maps.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

> Given an array `height[]` of non-negative integers where each element represents the height of a bar, compute how much water it can trap **after raining**.

---

### üß™ Example

```python
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

Explanation:

* Water is trapped between elevations.
* At index 2 ‚Üí trapped = min(1, 2) - 0 = 1
* At index 5 ‚Üí min(2, 3) - 0 = 2
* Total = 6 units

---

## ‚úÖ Optimal Approach: Two Pointer with Left/Right Max

### üí° Strategy

* Water at each index `i` = `min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]`
* Track `left_max` and `right_max` using two pointers
* Avoid extra space by using variables instead of arrays

## üßë‚Äçüíª Python Code with Inline Comments

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        if n < 3:
            return 0  # Less than 3 bars can't trap water

        left, right = 0, n - 1
        left_max, right_max = 0, 0
        trapped_water = 0

        while left < right:
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                if height[left] >= left_max:
                    left_max = height[left]
                else:
                    trapped_water += left_max - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if height[right] >= right_max:
                    right_max = height[right]
                else:
                    trapped_water += right_max - height[right]
                right -= 1

        return trapped_water
```

## ‚ùì Interview Q\&A

| Question                    | Answer                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Why use two pointers?       | It gives O(1) space vs O(n) space in prefix-max arrays |
| Can we solve with stack?    | Yes ‚Äî a monotonic stack is another popular method      |
| Can heights be zero?        | Yes, water can be trapped above height 0               |
| Can negative heights occur? | No ‚Äî constrained to non-negative integers              |
