Let's dive into the **Variable Sliding Window** technique ‚Äî a powerful extension of the fixed sliding window that dynamically adjusts its size based on a **constraint**.

---

## ü™ü What is the Variable Sliding Window Technique?

### üìå Definition:

A **variable window** is a subarray or substring whose size **changes dynamically** during iteration to **satisfy a certain condition**.

* Unlike fixed-size windows, the **start and end pointers move independently**.
* It helps solve problems where you need the **longest/shortest subarray/substring** that meets some condition.

## üß† When to Use It?

Use this technique when the problem asks for:

| Objective                                 | Example Problem                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Longest substring with unique characters  | Leetcode 3                          |
| Smallest window containing all characters | Leetcode 76                         |
| Max number of 1s with at most K flips     | Leetcode 1004 / GFG                 |
| Longest substring with ‚â§ K distinct chars | Leetcode 340                        |
| Count substrings matching pattern         | GFG ‚Äì Count Occurrences of Anagrams |

## üîß Core Template

```python
left = 0
for right in range(len(arr)):
    # Expand window by adding arr[right]
    
    while condition is violated:
        # Shrink window from the left
        left += 1

    # Check window validity or update result
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Leetcode 3)

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    char_set = set()
    left = max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

### üîç Key Observations:

* **Window size changes** dynamically based on repeated character detection.
* When a repeat is found, shrink the window from the **left** until valid again.

## üß™ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value |                              |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| Time   | O(n)  |                              |
| Space  | O(k)  | (at most `k` distinct chars) |

## üí° Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're standing at a buffet with a tray. You can only carry plates that satisfy a diet constraint (say ‚â§ 3 desserts). If you pick too many desserts, you remove some from the left side of your tray until you're within the limit again.

## ‚ûï Extensions with Hashmaps

Most variable window problems involve:

* **HashMaps** for counting characters
* **Frequency arrays**
* **Two pointers (left & right)**
