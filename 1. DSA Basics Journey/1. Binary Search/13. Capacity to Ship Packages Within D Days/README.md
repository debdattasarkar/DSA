Great! Let's walk through **LeetCode 1011: Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days**, a classic **Binary Search on the Answer** problem.

## 📦 Leetcode 1011: Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days

🔗 [Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days)

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement:

You are given:

* `weights`: a list of package weights (in order of arrival).
* `D`: number of days to ship all packages.

Each day you can ship packages with a total weight **not exceeding a given capacity** `C`.
Your goal is to **find the minimum value of `C`** such that **all packages can be shipped within `D` days**.

---

### 📌 Example:

```python
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5  
Output: 15
```

💡 Explanation:
One valid schedule for capacity 15 is:
`[1,2,3,4,5]`, `[6,7]`, `[8]`, `[9]`, `[10]`

---

## 🚀 Approach: Binary Search on Capacity

We are not searching positions — we are searching the **answer space**:

* **Lower bound (`left`)** = max(weights) — because you can't ship less than the heaviest package.
* **Upper bound (`right`)** = sum(weights) — ship all in 1 day.

---

### ✅ Binary Search Pseudocode:

1. While `left <= right`:

   * Let `mid = (left + right) // 2`
   * Check: Can we ship all within `D` days using capacity `mid`?

     * Yes → try a smaller capacity
     * No → try a larger one
2. Return `left`

---

### ✅ Python Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        def canShip(capacity: int) -> bool:
            days = 1
            total = 0
            for w in weights:
                if total + w > capacity:
                    days += 1
                    total = 0
                total += w
            return days <= D

        left = max(weights)        # Minimum feasible capacity
        right = sum(weights)       # Maximum (ship all in one day)

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if canShip(mid):
                right = mid        # Try smaller capacity
            else:
                left = mid + 1     # Need more capacity

        return left
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Complexity                                |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Time   | `O(n × log(sum(weights) - max(weights)))` |
| Space  | `O(1)` — constant extra space             |

---

## 🔁 Dry Run Example

**Input:** `weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`, `D = 5`

* `left = 10`, `right = 55`
* Try mid = 32 → can ship in 3 days → reduce right
* Try mid = 21 → can ship in 4 days → reduce right
* Try mid = 15 → ✅ can ship in 5 days
* Try mid = 14 → ❌ need 6 days → increase left

Eventually, you get **capacity = 15** as the minimum required.

## ✅ Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario                          | Explanation                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parcel delivery (FedEx, UPS)**  | Split packages across trucks over `D` days          |
| **Video or data chunk streaming** | Send packets in chunks while minimizing buffer size |
| **Production planning**           | Schedule workloads per day without overload         |

---

---

## ✅ Part 1: Enhanced Version — Return Actual Shipping Schedule

---

### 🧠 Goal:

In addition to finding the **minimum required capacity**, return the actual **shipping plan**:
A list of sublists where each sublist represents the packages shipped on a day.

---

### 🧩 Steps:

1. Use binary search to find the minimum feasible capacity (`min_cap`).
2. Run a **second greedy pass** using this `min_cap`, and construct the day-by-day shipping schedule.

---

### ✅ Python Code with Schedule Output

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

class Solution:
    def shipWithinDaysWithSchedule(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> Tuple[int, List[List[int]]]:
        def canShip(capacity: int) -> bool:
            days = 1
            total = 0
            for w in weights:
                if total + w > capacity:
                    days += 1
                    total = 0
                total += w
            return days <= D

        # Step 1: Binary Search to find minimum feasible capacity
        left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if canShip(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        min_capacity = left

        # Step 2: Build the actual shipping schedule
        schedule = []
        day = []
        total = 0
        remaining_days = D

        for i, w in enumerate(weights):
            if total + w > min_capacity or len(weights) - i < remaining_days:
                schedule.append(day)
                day = []
                total = 0
                remaining_days -= 1
            day.append(w)
            total += w

        if day:
            schedule.append(day)

        return min_capacity, schedule
```

---

### ✅ Example:

```python
weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
D = 5
sol = Solution()
capacity, schedule = sol.shipWithinDaysWithSchedule(weights, D)

print("Minimum Capacity:", capacity)
print("Schedule:", schedule)
```

**Output:**

```text
Minimum Capacity: 15
Schedule: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7], [8], [9], [10]]
```

---

## ✅ Part 2: Interview-Style Q\&A

Here are the **top interview questions** with **ideal answers** for this problem:

---

### ❓ 1. Why binary search on capacity?

🧠 **Answer:**
The number of days required to ship **decreases** as the ship capacity increases — it's a **monotonic** relationship.
This allows us to apply **binary search on the answer** space (`capacity ∈ [max, sum]`).

---

### ❓ 2. How do you check if a capacity is valid?

🧠 **Answer:**
Simulate day-by-day shipping:

* Accumulate weights until the current day is full.
* When capacity is exceeded, start a new day.
* Count how many days were used.
* If days used ≤ `D`, it's a valid capacity.

---

### ❓ 3. What's the time and space complexity?

🧠 **Answer:**

* **Time:** `O(n × log(sum - max))`
  (where `n = len(weights)`)
* **Space:** `O(n)` if building schedule, `O(1)` otherwise.

---

### ❓ 4. Why do we start binary search at `max(weights)`?

🧠 **Answer:**
We cannot ship a package heavier than the capacity — so the minimum capacity **must be** at least the heaviest package.

---

### ❓ 5. Can we minimize days instead of capacity?

🧠 **Answer:**
Yes — but that would require binary search on **days**, not capacity.
You'd fix a capacity and determine the **minimum number of days** needed — a different optimization target.

---

### ❓ 6. What if each day had a different capacity?

🧠 **Answer:**
You'd need to use a **bin-packing strategy**, possibly with dynamic programming.
This version is significantly more complex and not solvable in binary search directly.

---

### ❓ 7. Can this approach return the actual schedule?

🧠 **Answer:**
Yes — after finding the optimal capacity, use a greedy pass to assign packages to days, forming a valid **shipping schedule**.

---

### ❓ 8. Can this be solved with a greedy-only algorithm?

🧠 **Answer:**
Not efficiently. Greedy helps check feasibility, but binary search is required to find the **minimum possible capacity** efficiently.

---

---

Great! Let’s explore the **variant of Leetcode 1011** that supports **varying capacity or cost per day**, which brings us closer to real-world shipping constraints.

---

## 🚀 Variant: Shipping With Varying Capacity or Cost Per Day

### 🧩 Problem Statement (Extended):

You are given:

* `weights`: List of package weights (to be shipped in order)
* `capacities`: List of integers where `capacities[i]` is the max ship capacity on day `i`
* Goal: Determine whether it is **possible** to ship all packages using these variable daily capacities.

> Optionally: Also **minimize total cost**, if each capacity has a cost associated.

---

## ✅ Problem 1: Feasibility With Varying Capacities

---

### 🧠 Approach:

Loop through `capacities`, simulating each day:

* Try to pack as many packages as possible into that day (in order)
* Respect that day's capacity
* Move to the next day

---

### ✅ Python Code

```python
from typing import List

class ShippingScheduler:
    def canShipWithVaryingCapacities(self, weights: List[int], capacities: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(weights)
        idx = 0  # pointer to current package

        for cap in capacities:
            total = 0
            while idx < n and total + weights[idx] <= cap:
                total += weights[idx]
                idx += 1
            if idx == n:
                return True  # all packages shipped
        return idx == n  # return whether all packages were placed
```

---

### ✅ Example

```python
weights = [3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4]
capacities = [6, 5, 10]

scheduler = ShippingScheduler()
print(scheduler.canShipWithVaryingCapacities(weights, capacities))  # Output: True
```

---

## ✅ Problem 2: Minimize Cost With Daily Capacity Options

Now, instead of fixed `capacities`, suppose each day has a set of **(capacity, cost)** options:

```python
day_options = [
    [(10, 5), (15, 7)],  # Day 1
    [(8, 3), (12, 6)],   # Day 2
    ...
]
```

### 🧠 Goal:

Select one option per day to ship all packages and **minimize total cost**.

---

### 🔧 This becomes a form of **bounded knapsack with order constraint**, and best solved using **dynamic programming** with state:

```python
dp[i][j] = min cost to ship first i packages using first j days
```

It's significantly more complex and requires careful memoization or tabulation.

---

## 🧰 Tools You’d Need for That Version:

* 2D Dynamic Programming
* Greedy + Backtracking (for small input)
* Segment Tree (for range capacity selection optimization)

---

## ✅ Real-World Applications of This Variant

| Use Case                                       | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fleet with varying truck sizes**             | Different vehicle types available each day              |
| **Energy-constrained delivery (e.g., drones)** | Flight range/capacity varies due to weather or battery  |
| **Dynamic pricing in shipping**                | Higher capacity is costlier but allows earlier delivery |

---

---

Great! Let's build the **full dynamic programming (DP) solution** for the cost-optimization variant of **Leetcode 1011**, where each day offers multiple `(capacity, cost)` options.

---

## ✅ Problem Variant: Minimum Shipping Cost With Daily Capacity Options

### 🧩 Problem Statement:

You are given:

* `weights`: A list of packages (must be shipped in order).
* `days`: A list of lists. Each `days[i]` contains tuples `(capacity, cost)` for day `i`.

**Goal:**
Choose **one (capacity, cost) pair per day**, ship all packages in order, and **minimize the total cost**.

---

### 🔍 Key Constraints:

* Packages must be shipped in order.
* Each day must use only one selected ship capacity.
* If you can’t ship all packages within available days, return `-1`.

---

### ✅ Dynamic Programming Approach

#### State Definition:

Let:

* `dp[i][j]` = min cost to ship the first `i` packages using the first `j` days.

#### Transition:

For each day `j`:

* For each `(capacity, cost)` option:

  * Try to ship `k` packages from position `i` onward that fit in that capacity.
  * Update `dp[i + k][j + 1] = min(dp[i + k][j + 1], dp[i][j] + cost)`

---

### ✅ Python Code

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import sys

class ShippingCostOptimizer:
    def minShippingCost(self, weights: List[int], days: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> int:
        n = len(weights)
        D = len(days)
        
        # Initialize DP: dp[i] = min cost to ship first i packages
        dp = [sys.maxsize] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0  # No cost to ship zero packages

        for d in range(D):
            new_dp = [sys.maxsize] * (n + 1)
            for i in range(n + 1):
                if dp[i] == sys.maxsize:
                    continue
                for cap, cost in days[d]:
                    total = 0
                    j = i
                    while j < n and total + weights[j] <= cap:
                        total += weights[j]
                        j += 1
                        new_dp[j] = min(new_dp[j], dp[i] + cost)
            dp = new_dp

        return dp[n] if dp[n] != sys.maxsize else -1
```

---

### 📌 Example Usage

```python
weights = [2, 4, 5, 1, 2]
days = [
    [(5, 10), (10, 20)],    # Day 0 options
    [(7, 12), (10, 15)],    # Day 1 options
    [(5, 7), (15, 18)]      # Day 2 options
]

optimizer = ShippingCostOptimizer()
print(optimizer.minShippingCost(weights, days))  # Output: Minimum total cost or -1 if not possible
```

---

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time:** `O(D × n × k × m)`

  * `D` = number of days
  * `n` = number of packages
  * `k` = number of (capacity, cost) options per day
  * `m` = max packages that can be loaded per day
* **Space:** `O(n)` — only previous and current dp rows

---

## 🧠 Extension Ideas

* Track and return the actual schedule (which packages on which day).
* Introduce cost penalties for late shipments.
* Limit which packages can be shipped on which days (e.g., availability constraints).
