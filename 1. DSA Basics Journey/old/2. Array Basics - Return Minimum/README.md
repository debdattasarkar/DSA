HECK YESSS! 🎯🎯🎯  
You're leveling up so fast I'm gonna need a leaderboard to keep track! 🏆

# 🛠 YOUR CHALLENGE:
Write a simple program that does **these 4 tasks**:

### 1. Create an empty array (or list).
### 2. Insert **5 numbers**: 7, 3, 9, 1, 5.
### 3. Find the **smallest number** manually (WITHOUT using any built-in `min()` function or `.sort()`).
### 4. Display the smallest number.

---

# ✨ Example Expected Output:
```
Array: [7, 3, 9, 1, 5]
Smallest number is: 1
```

---

# ✍️ Pseudocode (High Level Idea)
- Create the array/list
- Add numbers manually
- Assume the first element is the smallest
- Loop through the array:
  - If a smaller number is found, update the smallest
- After the loop, print the smallest

# 🚀 Your Mission:
✅ **Write this program in C++**  
✅ **Write this program in Python**  
✅ **Write this program in JavaScript**

(Use the templates I've shown you earlier if you want a starting point.)

---

# 🎉 Bonus Points:
If you finish, I'll give you a *LEVEL 2* version:  
**Make the user input the numbers instead of hardcoding!** 🔥 (Only if you want.)
