💥 Oh YESS! You're asking for the **right tool + topic combo** now:
**Hash Maps + Arrays = 🔥 Combo** used in **tons** of interview problems — from Easy to 🔥 Hardcore.

# 📦 Why Hash Maps with Arrays?

Hash maps help you solve array problems **efficiently** by:

* Tracking **frequencies**
* Recording **indices**
* Avoiding **nested loops**
* Reducing time from O(n²) → O(n)

# 🧠 Curated Hash Map + Array Problems (Sorted by Difficulty):

---

## 🟢 **EASY LEVEL**

### 1. **Find Duplicates**

🧪 Input: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` → Output: `True`
📦 Use a hash set to track seen numbers.

```python
def has_duplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

---

### 2. **Frequency Counter**

🧪 Input: `[1,1,2,3,2,4]` → Output: `{1:2, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1}`

```python
from collections import Counter
nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
print(Counter(nums))
```

## 🟡 **MEDIUM LEVEL**

### 3. **Subarray Sum Equals K**

✅ Asked in: Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe

> Count number of subarrays that sum to `k`.

🧪 Input: `[1, 2, 3], k = 3` → Output: `2`
(Solutions: `[1,2]`, `[3]`)

```python
def subarray_sum(nums, k):
    count = 0
    curr_sum = 0
    prefix = {0: 1}
    
    for num in nums:
        curr_sum += num
        if (curr_sum - k) in prefix:
            count += prefix[curr_sum - k]
        prefix[curr_sum] = prefix.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1

    return count
```

### 4. **Longest Subarray with Equal 0s and 1s**

✅ Asked in: Amazon, Paytm, Google

> Convert 0s to -1s, then find longest subarray with sum 0.

```python
def longest_equal_zeros_ones(arr):
    mp = {0: -1}
    max_len = 0
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        count += -1 if arr[i] == 0 else 1
        if count in mp:
            max_len = max(max_len, i - mp[count])
        else:
            mp[count] = i
    return max_len
```

Absolutely! 🙌
This is a **clever and powerful hash map trick** that comes up often in interviews — and understanding it **line by line** will make it one of your go-to patterns. 🧠🔧

---

### 🚀 Problem Summary:

> Given a binary array (with only 0s and 1s), find the **length of the longest subarray** with **equal number of 0s and 1s**.

---

### 📌 Example Input:

```python
arr = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
```

### Expected Output:

```
6  # subarray [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] with equal 0s and 1s
```

---

### ✅ Full Code:

```python
def longest_equal_zeros_ones(arr):
    mp = {0: -1}
    max_len = 0
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        count += -1 if arr[i] == 0 else 1
        if count in mp:
            max_len = max(max_len, i - mp[count])
        else:
            mp[count] = i
    return max_len
```

---

## 🧠 LINE-BY-LINE EXPLANATION:

---

### `mp = {0: -1}`

* We use a **hash map (`mp`)** to store the **first index where a particular cumulative count occurred.**
* It starts with `{0: -1}` to handle the case where a valid subarray **starts from index 0**.

  * For example, if your array starts with `[0, 1]`, count will become `0` at index 1.

---

### `max_len = 0`

* Keeps track of the **maximum length** of the balanced subarray found so far.

---

### `count = 0`

* We use this as a **balance counter**:

  * Treat `0` as `-1`
  * Treat `1` as `+1`
* So every time you see a:

  * `0` → `count -= 1`
  * `1` → `count += 1`

**If `count == 0`, it means the number of 0s and 1s are equal** from the beginning or from some previous index.

---

### `for i in range(len(arr)):`

* Loop through the array with index `i`.

---

### `count += -1 if arr[i] == 0 else 1`

* This updates the balance:

  * `arr[i] == 0` → subtract 1 (treat as negative)
  * `arr[i] == 1` → add 1
* This transforms the problem into:

  > “Find the longest subarray where the total count is 0.”

---

### `if count in mp:`

* If we’ve **seen this balance before**, it means the subarray **between the previous index and the current index has equal 0s and 1s**.

---

### `max_len = max(max_len, i - mp[count])`

* Calculate the length of this valid subarray.
* Compare it with the current max and update if larger.

---

### `else: mp[count] = i`

* If this balance is seen for the **first time**, store the index.
* Why? Because we want the **longest possible subarray**, so we store the **first occurrence** only.

---

### `return max_len`

* After the loop finishes, return the longest subarray length found.

---

## 🔍 Example Trace:

```python
arr = [0, 1, 0, 1]
```

| i | arr\[i] | count | mp              | Subarray Length | max\_len |
| - | ------- | ----- | --------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| 0 | 0       | -1    | {0:-1, -1:0}    | —               | 0        |
| 1 | 1       | 0     | {0:-1, -1:0}    | 1 - (-1) = 2    | 2        |
| 2 | 0       | -1    | already in `mp` | 2 - 0 = 2       | 2        |
| 3 | 1       | 0     | already in `mp` | 3 - (-1) = 4    | 4 ✅      |

# 🏁 Summary:

This technique is 🔥 for any binary (or 2-value) problems involving **count balancing**.

✅ Problem converted into a **prefix sum** problem
✅ Used a **hash map to track first seen index for each prefix sum**
✅ Achieves **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space

✅ Asked in: Amazon, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Facebook

```python
def longest_consecutive(nums):
    num_set = set(nums)
    longest = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num - 1 not in num_set:  # Start of sequence
            length = 1
            while num + length in num_set:
                length += 1
            longest = max(longest, length)
    
    return longest

        groups[key].append(word)
    return list(groups.values())
```
