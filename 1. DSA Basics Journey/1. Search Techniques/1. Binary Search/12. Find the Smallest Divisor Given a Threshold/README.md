## 📦 LeetCode 1011: Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days

🔗 [Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days)

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement:

You are given an array `weights` where `weights[i]` is the weight of the `i-th` package.
You need to ship all packages within **`D` days**, in the **given order**.

Each day, you can load packages with a total weight ≤ ship's capacity `C`.
Find the **minimum capacity `C`** needed to ship all packages in **at most `D` days**.

---

### 📌 Example:

```python
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5  
Output: 15

Explanation:
Minimum capacity of 15 allows one valid schedule:
[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7], [8], [9], [10]
```

---

## 🚀 Strategy: Binary Search on Answer

We do **binary search on capacity `C`**, which ranges from:

* **min = max(weights)** (must carry the heaviest box at least)
* **max = sum(weights)** (can carry all in one day)

### ✅ For each mid value (`C`), we check:

> Can we ship everything in ≤ `D` days using this capacity?

If yes → try smaller capacity
If no → increase capacity

---

### ✅ Python Code (Optimized)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        def canShip(capacity: int) -> bool:
            days = 1
            total = 0
            for w in weights:
                if total + w > capacity:
                    days += 1
                    total = 0
                total += w
            return days <= D

        left = max(weights)         # At least must carry the heaviest box
        right = sum(weights)        # At most all in one day

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if canShip(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return left
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                 |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Time   | `O(n log(sum - max))` |
| Space  | `O(1)`                |

---

## 🔁 Dry Run Example:

Input: `weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5`

* Try capacity = 15
* Can ship in exactly 5 days → ✅
* Try to minimize → search left
* Final answer: **15**

---

## ✅ Real-World Use Cases

1. **Parcel Delivery & Logistics Optimization**

   * Minimize truck capacity to reduce cost while meeting delivery deadlines.

2. **Streaming Data or File Chunking**

   * Minimize buffer size or bandwidth to process data chunks within time constraints.

3. **Job Scheduling with Load Limits**

   * Assign variable-weighted jobs across days with deadline constraints.

Here are the **interview questions and expected answers** related to **Leetcode 1011: Capacity to Ship Packages Within D Days**, a classic **Binary Search on Answer** problem.

---

## ✅ Common Interview Questions & Answers

---

### 🔹 1. **Why do we use Binary Search here?**

**Answer:**
Because the function **f(C) = number of days to ship with capacity C** is **monotonic**:

* If we increase capacity, required days **decrease** (or stay the same).
* If we decrease capacity, required days **increase**.
  This monotonic nature allows us to binary search for the **minimum feasible capacity**.

---

### 🔹 2. **What is the search space?**

**Answer:**

* Lower bound: `max(weights)` → You must be able to carry the heaviest package.
* Upper bound: `sum(weights)` → If you carry all packages in one day.
* We binary search within `[max(weights), sum(weights)]`.

---

### 🔹 3. **How do you validate if a capacity is feasible?**

**Answer:**
Simulate shipping the packages in order.

* Accumulate weight until you exceed capacity.
* Then start a new day.
* Count how many days you needed.
* If total days ≤ `D`, the capacity is valid.

---

### 🔹 4. **What is the time complexity of your solution?**

**Answer:**

* Let `n` be the number of packages.
* The binary search runs in `O(log(sum - max))`, and each feasibility check runs in `O(n)`.
* So total time: **`O(n × log(sum - max))`**

---

### 🔹 5. **Can you use a greedy approach without binary search?**

**Answer:**
Not efficiently.

* A pure greedy strategy can’t guarantee the **minimum capacity**.
* Binary search ensures we find the smallest possible `C` that works.

---

### 🔹 6. **Can we optimize the simulation function further?**

**Answer:**
The current `O(n)` greedy simulation is already optimal — it only requires one pass through the weights.
No significant further optimization unless preconditions are relaxed.

---

### 🔹 7. **What changes if the weights are not in order or contain zero?**

**Answer:**

* Unordered weights don't affect the logic since we process them in input order.
* Zero-weight packages are valid and don’t break the algorithm.
* Problem **requires preserving order**, so we must respect the given sequence.

---

### 🔹 8. **What if the goal was to minimize days instead of capacity?**

**Answer:**
You’d need to binary search on `D` instead.

* Fix a capacity and binary search over feasible `D` values.
* Reverse of this problem’s goal.

---

## 💡 Follow-up Ideas for Senior Interviews

* Return the actual shipment plan (split array by day).
* Optimize for cost based on capacity vs number of days.
* Handle multiple ships/day or variable ship capacities.

---

---

Let’s discuss all three **senior-level follow-up ideas** from **Leetcode 1011 (Ship Packages Within D Days)** in detail:

---

## ✅ 1. Return the Actual Shipment Plan (Split Array by Day)

### 🧠 Goal:

Instead of just computing the minimum capacity, also return the actual **schedule** — how the packages are split over the `D` days.

---

### 🔧 Approach:

1. **First**, run the standard binary search to find the **minimum feasible capacity** `C`.
2. **Second**, simulate the greedy shipping process again with capacity `C`, this time **recording splits** as daily shipments.

---

### 🔁 Example:

```python
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], D = 5, min_capacity = 15

→ Shipment Plan:
Day 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Day 2: [6, 7]  
Day 3: [8]  
Day 4: [9]
Day 5: []
```

You would **backfill** remaining days if the number of used days is < `D`.

---

### 📦 Use Case:

* Logistics systems where **shipment breakdowns per day** must be planned explicitly.

---

## ✅ 2. Optimize for Cost Based on Capacity vs Days

### 🧠 Goal:

Instead of minimizing just capacity, consider a **cost function** like:

```python
cost = α × capacity + β × days_used
```

Where:

* `α` = cost per unit capacity (e.g. bigger trucks are more expensive)
* `β` = cost per day (e.g. labor, storage)

---

### 🔧 Approach:

* Binary search over feasible capacity range.
* For each candidate capacity `C`, simulate the number of days `d`.
* Compute `cost(C, d)` and track the **minimum total cost**.

---

### 📌 Note:

* The optimal capacity under cost tradeoffs might not be the **minimum feasible** one.
* Could use **ternary search** or **search for minimum cost in answer space**.

---

### 💰 Use Case:

* Cost-sensitive logistics & shipping systems, e.g., e-commerce, freight, or trucking.

---

## ✅ 3. Handle Multiple Ships Per Day or Variable Ship Capacities

### 🧠 Goal:

* Each day can use **multiple ships** with a maximum capacity.
* Or, ship capacity varies **per day** due to constraints or maintenance.

---

### 🔧 Variants & Strategies:

#### a) **Multiple Ships per Day (Fixed Capacity)**

* For each day, pack as many full ships as needed with max `capacity`.
* Constraint becomes:

  * Is it possible to **ship everything in `D` days** using unlimited ships per day?

You simulate the process with an inner loop that fills ships per day.

#### b) **Variable Capacity per Day (List of daily limits)**

```python
capacities = [10, 15, 20, 10]  # day 1 to 4
```

* Simulate shipment where each day's total shipped weight cannot exceed `capacities[day]`.

This becomes a **bin packing problem with daily bins**, and may need **greedy + DP**.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used:

* 2D DP
* Min-heap (to schedule earliest ship slots)
* Segment trees (for range capacity queries/updates)

---

### 🚚 Use Case:

* Fleet management with varying truck/ship availability.
* Delivery planning across **variable conditions** (e.g., holidays, weather, fuel constraints).
