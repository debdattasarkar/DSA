## 🐵 Leetcode 875: Koko Eating Bananas

🔗 [LeetCode 875](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

### 🧩 Problem Statement:

Koko has `n` piles of bananas. She can eat at most `k` bananas per hour.
Given a list of pile sizes `piles` and an integer `h` (hours), return the **minimum integer speed `k`** such that Koko can eat all bananas in `h` hours.

---

## 🧠 Example:

```python
Input:  piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

Explanation:

* At speed 4/hr:
  3→1hr, 6→2hr, 7→2hr, 11→3hr → total = 8 hrs ✅

---

## 🚀 Strategy: Binary Search on Minimum `k`

### ✅ Why Binary Search?

* `k` ranges from `1` to `max(piles)`
* For a given `k`, we can compute how many hours it would take.
* If it's ≤ `h`, try a **smaller k**
* Else, try a **larger k**

---

## ✅ Python Code (Optimized)

```python
from typing import List
import math

class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, max(piles)
        answer = right

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            hours_needed = sum(math.ceil(pile / mid) for pile in piles)

            if hours_needed <= h:
                answer = mid  # Try to minimize
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return answer
```

Let’s break down this Python line of code:

```python
hours_needed = sum(math.ceil(pile / mid) for pile in piles)
```

---

## ✅ Context

* `piles` is a list of banana piles.
* `mid` represents a **candidate eating speed** (bananas per hour).
* We want to find out how many **hours** it would take to finish all piles at that speed.

---

## ✅ Explanation

### 🔸 `pile / mid`

* This computes how many **hours it would take** to eat the `pile` if Koko eats `mid` bananas per hour.

### 🔸 `math.ceil(pile / mid)`

* Since Koko **can’t eat a fraction of an hour**, we **round up**:

  * If `pile = 8` and `mid = 3`, then she takes `ceil(8/3) = ceil(2.67) = 3 hours`.
* This tells you **how many full hours** are needed for that pile.

### 🔸 `for pile in piles`

* Apply this logic to **each pile** in the `piles` list.

### 🔸 `sum(...)`

* Add up all the hours required for each pile.

---

## ✅ Example

```python
piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]
mid = 4  # candidate speed
```

We compute:

```python
hours_needed = sum(ceil(3/4), ceil(6/4), ceil(7/4), ceil(11/4))
             = sum(1, 2, 2, 3)
             = 8
```

So, Koko needs `8` hours to eat all bananas at speed `mid = 4`.

## 🧪 Dry Run: `piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8`

| k | Time Needed  | h OK? | Action         |
| - | ------------ | ----- | -------------- |
| 6 | 1+1+2+2 = 6  | ✅     | try smaller k  |
| 3 | 1+2+3+4 = 10 | ❌     | try larger k   |
| 4 | 1+2+2+3 = 8  | ✅     | save, go lower |
| 2 | 2+3+4+6 = 15 | ❌     | increase k     |

✅ Answer: `4`

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Time   | `O(n × log m)` where `m = max(piles)` |
| Space  | `O(1)`                                |

## 💬 Interview Follow-Up Questions

1. Can you prove the function is **monotonic** in `k`?
2. What if `h < len(piles)`?
3. How would this change if Koko can split piles mid-hour?

# ✅ Core Interview Questions & Answers

---

### 🔸 1. **What is the problem asking you to find?**

**Answer:**
To find the **minimum integer eating speed `k`** such that Koko can eat all banana piles within `h` hours.

---

### 🔸 2. **Why does a binary search apply here?**

**Answer:**
The problem has a **monotonic condition**:

* As `k` (speed) increases, the total time required to eat all bananas **decreases**.
* This allows us to **binary search over possible values of `k`** in the range `[1, max(piles)]`.

---

### 🔸 3. **What is the search space?**

**Answer:**
The possible values of `k` range from:

* **1** (slowest possible speed)
* to **max(piles)** (fastest — eats the largest pile in 1 hour)

---

### 🔸 4. **What is the condition inside the binary search?**

**Answer:**
For each `mid` (candidate `k`), calculate:

```python
hours_needed = sum(ceil(pile / k) for pile in piles)
```

* If `hours_needed <= h` → valid speed → search left
* Else → speed too slow → search right

---

### 🔸 5. **What is the time complexity of your solution?**

**Answer:**

* Outer binary search: `log(max(piles))`
* Inner loop for each speed trial: `O(n)`
* **Total:** `O(n × log(max(piles)))`

---

### 🔸 6. **Can there be multiple valid values of `k`?**

**Answer:**
Yes. The problem asks for the **minimum such valid `k`**, so we need to keep shrinking the right side of our binary search window when valid.

---

### 🔸 7. **Why do we use `ceil(pile / k)` instead of integer division?**

**Answer:**
Because Koko **can't eat partial bananas** in an hour. If a pile is `7` and she eats at speed `k=3`, she needs:

```python
ceil(7 / 3) = 3 hours
```

instead of `7 // 3 = 2` which undercounts.

---

### 🔸 8. **What happens if `h < len(piles)`?**

**Answer:**
It becomes **impossible**, because Koko needs **at least 1 hour per pile**. But per the problem's constraint, a solution is always guaranteed.

---

### 🔸 9. **What if piles contain extremely large numbers (e.g. 10⁹)?**

**Answer:**
The algorithm still works efficiently due to the logarithmic search over `k`.
Even with very large piles, `log(max(piles))` keeps runtime manageable.

---

### 🔸 10. **Can you optimize the space?**

**Answer:**
The algorithm already uses **O(1) space** — no extra arrays or structures are needed.

---

## 🧠 Bonus Follow-ups (for senior roles):

### 🔹 What if Koko could eat fractional bananas?

* Then we could compute total time directly with division (`pile / k`) — no ceiling needed.
* Still solvable, possibly without integer constraints.

### 🔹 How would you adapt this to minimize the number of hours instead?

* Fix `k`, binary search on `h` instead (reverse direction of binary search).

# 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

Here are a few **very important real-world use cases** of the **Koko Eating Bananas** problem pattern (also known as **Binary Search on the Answer**):

---

### ✅ 1. **Download/Upload Speed Optimization**

* Determine the **minimum network bandwidth** needed to transfer data within a deadline.

---

### ✅ 2. **Resource Allocation (e.g., Cloud or Job Scheduling)**

* Find the **minimum number of servers or workers** required to process all jobs within a time limit.

---

### ✅ 3. **Manufacturing & Assembly Lines**

* Compute the **minimum speed or capacity per machine** to finish production within given hours.

---

These scenarios involve optimizing speed, capacity, or effort under **time constraints**, and binary search on the answer is a powerful way to solve them efficiently.
