## ‚õΩÔ∏è **Leetcode 774: Minimize Maximum Distance to Gas Station**

### üîó Problem Statement:

You are given:

* A sorted array `stations[]` where each element represents the **position** of a gas station along a highway.
* An integer `k` representing the **number of additional stations** you can add.

üìå **Goal:** Add at most `k` new gas stations so that the **maximum distance between any two adjacent stations is minimized**.
Return that **minimum possible maximum distance** (as a floating-point number).

---

### üß† Key Insight:

You're minimizing the **maximum gap** between stations after adding at most `k` new ones.

The distance function is:

```
f(d) = number of gas stations needed so that all gaps ‚â§ d
```

‚úÖ This function is **monotonically decreasing** in `d` ‚Üí the smaller the distance you want, the more stations you'll need.

## ‚úÖ Suitable Search Technique?

| Technique      | Applicability                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Binary Search  | ‚úÖ Yes                                                 |
| Ternary Search | ‚úÖ Yes (optional, as function is unimodal numerically) |

> Since the function `total_stations_needed(d)` has a **single valley** (cost increases as distance shrinks), **ternary search** or **binary search on float answer** both work.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach: Binary Search on Answer (with float precision)

We‚Äôll perform binary search in the range:

```
low = 0.0
high = max_gap (initial gap between stations)
```

At each step:

* Calculate how many **new stations** are needed if **max gap is at most `mid`**
* Adjust the range accordingly

---

## ‚úÖ Python Code (Binary Search on Float Answer)

```python
def minmaxGasDist(stations, k):
    import math

    def required_stations(d):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(stations)):
            gap = stations[i] - stations[i - 1]
            count += int(gap / d)
        return count

    left, right = 0.0, stations[-1] - stations[0]
    eps = 1e-6

    while right - left > eps:
        mid = (left + right) / 2.0
        if required_stations(mid) > k:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid

    return right
```

---

## üîÅ Dry Run Example

```python
stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]
k = 1
```

* Initial gap = 5
* Can insert 1 station in \[5,10] to balance the max gap

‚úÖ Final answer: around `2.5`

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Time       | `O(n * log10^6)` ‚Üí due to float precision |
| Space      | `O(1)`                                    |

---

## üìå Interview Insights:

* **What to explain:** Monotonic nature of station count as `d` shrinks.
* **Alternative method:** Priority Queue (Greedy with max-heap to split largest gap).
* **Variations:** What if you had **fixed cost per station**, or **budget instead of count**?

---

---

Yes! Let‚Äôs implement **Leetcode 774: Minimize Maximum Distance to Gas Station** using the **ternary search technique** instead of the usual binary search.

---

## ‚úÖ Why Ternary Search Works Here

We want to **minimize** the **maximum distance** between stations, so we define a numeric, unimodal cost function:

```python
f(d) = number of additional stations needed if the max allowed gap is d
```

* `f(d)` is **monotonically decreasing**: as `d` increases, fewer stations are needed.
* We‚Äôre looking for the smallest `d` such that `f(d) ‚â§ k`.

üìå This shape is perfect for **ternary search**, because `f(d)` is **unimodal** over `d ‚àà [low, high]`.

---

## üßÆ Python Code (Ternary Search on Float Domain)

```python
def minmaxGasDist_ternary(stations, k):
    def required_stations(distance):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(stations)):
            gap = stations[i] - stations[i - 1]
            count += int(gap / distance)
        return count

    left, right = 0.0, stations[-1] - stations[0]
    eps = 1e-6  # Precision level

    while right - left > eps:
        mid1 = left + (right - left) / 3
        mid2 = right - (right - left) / 3

        need1 = required_stations(mid1)
        need2 = required_stations(mid2)

        if need1 <= k and need2 <= k:
            # Both are valid, try to minimize further
            right = mid2
        elif need1 > k:
            left = mid1
        else:
            right = mid2

    return left
```

---

## üß™ Example Run

```python
stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]
k = 1
ans = minmaxGasDist_ternary(stations, k)
print(f"Minimum possible max distance ‚âà {ans:.6f}")
```

Expected Output:

```
Minimum possible max distance ‚âà 2.5
```

## ‚úÖ Time & Space Complexity

| Type  | Complexity       |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Time  | `O(n * log10^6)` |
| Space | `O(1)`           |

This is the same asymptotic complexity as binary search on floats ‚Äî the difference is **search style**.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Technique      | Purpose                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Ternary Search | Find minimum `d` where `f(d) ‚â§ k`           |
| `f(d)`         | Number of stations needed for max gap ‚â§ `d` |

## ‚úÖ Shared Elements

| Feature       | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `stations[]`  | Sorted list of gas station positions            |
| `k`           | Maximum number of additional stations allowed   |
| Cost function | `f(d) = stations needed to ensure all gaps ‚â§ d` |

| Precision     | 1e-6 tolerance (float domain)                   |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Binary Search Approach**

### üîß Key Logic:

Search over `d ‚àà [0, max_gap]`, and at each `mid`, check if:

```python
required_stations(mid) <= k
```

### üß† Behavior:

* Monotonic: as `d ‚Üë`, `stations_needed ‚Üì`
* Shrink interval based on condition

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Simple, intuitive
* Industry-standard
* Works for any monotonic constraint

### üîª Cons:

* Not always best for optimization functions

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time:

`O(n * log10^6)`

---

## üîÅ **Ternary Search Approach**

### üîß Key Logic:

Define:

```python
f(d) = number of stations needed if gap ‚â§ d
```

Treat `f(d)` as **unimodal**, and minimize `d` via ternary search:

```python
mid1 = l + (r - l)/3
mid2 = r - (r - l)/3
```

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Conceptually aligns with **numeric optimization**
* Cleaner when `f(d)` is true mathematical function

### üîª Cons:

* Slightly harder to implement
* May do more checks than binary in edge cases

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time:

`O(n * log10^6)` (same as binary)

Let's revisit **Leetcode 774: Minimize Maximum Distance to Gas Station** and explore the solution fully using **Ternary Search**, as requested.

---

## üîç Problem Summary

> You're given a list `stations[]` of positions of gas stations on a number line. You may add up to `k` more gas stations anywhere between existing ones.

**Goal:**
Minimize the **maximum distance** between adjacent gas stations after adding up to `k` stations.

---

## üß† Key Insight

We define a cost function:

```python
f(d) = number of additional stations needed if no gap > d
```

* `f(d)` is **monotonically decreasing**.
* We want the **smallest `d`** such that `f(d) ‚â§ k`.

This is a classic **minimization over a unimodal function**, making it perfect for **ternary search** on a continuous domain.

---

## ‚úÖ Ternary Search Implementation

```python
def minmaxGasDist(stations, k):
    def required_stations(d):
        # Calculate how many new stations are needed for max distance <= d
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(stations)):
            gap = stations[i] - stations[i - 1]
            count += int(gap / d)
        return count

    # Ternary Search on float domain
    left = 0.0
    right = stations[-1] - stations[0]
    eps = 1e-6

    while right - left > eps:
        mid1 = left + (right - left) / 3
        mid2 = right - (right - left) / 3

        if required_stations(mid1) <= k:
            right = mid2
        else:
            left = mid1

    return left
```

### üß™ Example

```python
stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]
k = 1
print(f"Minimum max distance ‚âà {minmaxGasDist(stations, k):.6f}")
```

Output:

```
Minimum max distance ‚âà 2.500000
