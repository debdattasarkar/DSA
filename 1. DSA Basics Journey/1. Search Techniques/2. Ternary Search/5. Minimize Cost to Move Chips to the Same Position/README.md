Let‚Äôs walk through a **ternary search approach** to a **generalized version** of the problem:

---

## üéØ Problem (Variant with Continuous Cost):

> Given `chips = [x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô]`, move all chips to a **single position `p`** (not necessarily an existing position) to **minimize total cost**, where:

$$
\text{cost}(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |chips[i] - p|
$$

This cost function is:

* **Unimodal**: shaped like a "V"
* **Convex**: ideal for ternary search

---

## ‚úÖ Ternary Search Plan

We‚Äôll perform ternary search over the range of positions `p` from `min(chips)` to `max(chips)` to minimize the cost.

### üîß Helper Function:

```python
def total_cost(chips, pos):
    return sum(abs(chip - pos) for chip in chips)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Full Python Code using Ternary Search

```python
def total_cost(chips, pos):
    return sum(abs(chip - pos) for chip in chips)

def minCostToMoveChips_ternary(chips):
    left = min(chips)
    right = max(chips)

    # Ternary search on integer domain
    while right - left > 2:
        mid1 = left + (right - left) // 3
        mid2 = right - (right - left) // 3

        cost1 = total_cost(chips, mid1)
        cost2 = total_cost(chips, mid2)

        if cost1 < cost2:
            right = mid2
        else:
            left = mid1

    # Final linear scan in narrowed range
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for pos in range(left, right + 1):
        min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost(chips, pos))

    return min_cost
```

---

### üß™ Example

```python
chips = [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
print(minCostToMoveChips_ternary(chips))  # Output: 6
```

This returns the **minimum total movement cost** using ternary search on the **numeric position domain**.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Value           |
| ------ | --------------- |
| Time   | O(n log(range)) |
| Space  | O(1)            |

## üìå Reminder

* The original **Leetcode 1217** uses a much simpler rule (even/odd parity logic).
* This **ternary version** handles **continuous cost** based on absolute distance ‚Äî more general and great for learning!

Let‚Äôs go over **Leetcode 1217: Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position** step by step.

---

## üß© Problem Summary

> You‚Äôre given an array `chips[]` representing positions of chips on a number line. You can move chips as follows:

* Move **by 2 positions** (left or right) ‚Üí **cost = 0**
* Move **by 1 position** ‚Üí **cost = 1**

üéØ Return the **minimum cost** to bring all chips to the same position.

---

## üß† Key Insight

* Moving by **even numbers is free**.
* So:

  * All chips on **even positions** can move to other even positions for **free**
  * All chips on **odd positions** can move to other odd positions for **free**
  * Only moving between **even ‚Üî odd** costs 1 per chip

‚úÖ Therefore, the **optimal strategy** is to move the **minority group** (even or odd) to the other side.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Answer

```python
min(even_count, odd_count)
```

---

## üîß Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostToMoveChips(self, position: list[int]) -> int:
        even = sum(1 for x in position if x % 2 == 0)
        odd = len(position) - even
        return min(even, odd)
```

---

## üîÅ Example

```python
Input: position = [1, 2, 3]
even = 1 (2), odd = 2 (1 and 3)
Output: 1
```

## ‚è± Time & Space Complexity

| Time   | O(n)  |
| Space  | O(1)  |

## ‚ùì Interview Questions

| Question                            | Expected Answer                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Why is the cost 0 for steps of 2?   | Because moving by 2 doesn't count toward the cost |
| Why just count even and odd?        | Because only cross-parity movement costs 1        |
| Can you prove the optimal strategy? | Yes ‚Äî it's always cheaper to move fewer chips     |

## üö´ Why Ternary Search Doesn‚Äôt Apply

* There's **no continuous cost function** over a numeric domain
* The answer is **discrete and count-based**, not **function-minimization**
* This is a **pure counting problem**, not an optimization over a curve
