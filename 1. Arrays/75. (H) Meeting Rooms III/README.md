To solve the **Meeting Rooms III** problem from GeeksforGeeks, we simulate room assignment while keeping track of:

* When each room becomes available.
* Which room has hosted the most meetings.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary

You're given:

* `n` rooms (`0` to `n-1`)
* `meetings[i] = [starti, endi]`

**Goal**: Find the room with the most meetings.
If a tie, return the room with the smallest number.

**Rules**:

* Assign the meeting to the earliest available room (smallest number).
* If no room is free, delay it until the earliest room is free but retain the meeting's duration.
* Always prioritize assigning to rooms with the smallest number.

---

## üîç Strategy

Use two heaps:

* **Available Rooms Min-Heap** ‚Üí Sorted by room number.
* **Occupied Rooms Min-Heap** ‚Üí `(end_time, room_number)`.

Use a `meeting_count[]` array to track how many meetings each room has hosted.

### Steps:

1. **Sort meetings by start time.**
2. **Initialize** available rooms heap with all room numbers.
3. For each meeting:

   * Release rooms that are now available (i.e., their end time is <= current meeting's start).
   * If available rooms exist, assign the meeting to the smallest room.
   * If all rooms are occupied, **delay** the meeting until the earliest one is free and **reschedule** accordingly.
4. Track how many meetings each room is assigned.
5. Return the room with the maximum count (and smallest room number in case of tie).

## üîÑ Dry Run

`n = 2`
`meetings = [[0, 6], [2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 8], [6, 8]]`

Meeting 0: assign to room 0
Meeting 1: room 1 is free ‚Üí assign
Meeting 2: room 1 is free ‚Üí assign
Meeting 3: no room free ‚Üí delay until 6 ‚Üí assign to room 0
Meeting 4: no room free ‚Üí delay until 7 ‚Üí assign to room 1

Room usage:

* Room 0: 2 meetings
* Room 1: 3 meetings ‚Üí return **1**
