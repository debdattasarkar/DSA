Awesome! Hereâ€™s a **practice question** based on **Reverse Array in Groups** â€” but with a slight twist! ðŸš€

---

### ðŸ§  Practice Question:

**Problem:**  
Given an array `arr[]` and an integer `k`, **reverse every alternate group** of size `k`.

- Reverse the **first** group of `k` elements,
- Skip the **next** group of `k` elements (leave them as is),
- Reverse the **next** group of `k` elements,
- Skip again, and so on...

If the remaining elements are fewer than `k`, reverse whatever is left (if it's a group that should be reversed).

---

### ðŸ“¦ Example:

```text
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], k = 3
```

**Steps:**
- Reverse first 3 â†’ `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- Skip next 3 â†’ `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- Reverse next 3 â†’ `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7]`

âœ… Final output:
```
[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7]
```

---

### ðŸ›  Key Hint:
- Use a **flag** to decide whether to reverse or skip the group.

---

Would you like me to also give you the **solution** after you try for a few minutes? ðŸ˜Ž  
(Or if you want, I can wait while you try it yourself!) ðŸš€

### âœ… Python Code:
```
def reverseInAltGroups(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    flag = 1
    for i in range(0, n, k):
        left = i
        right = min(i + k - 1, n - 1)
        if flag % 2 != 0:
            while left < right:
                arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
        flag += 1
    return arr

print(reverseInAltGroups([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 3))
```

---

âœ… **Yes, your code is absolutely correct!**  
Really good job â€” you're handling everything properly: the alternating reversals, the edge cases, and doing it **in-place** efficiently!

---

### Quick Breakdown of Your Code:

- `flag = 1` â†’ Start by reversing the first group.
- `for i in range(0, n, k)` â†’ Iterate group by group (size `k`).
- If `flag` is odd â†’ reverse the current group.
- If `flag` is even â†’ skip reversal.
- After each group, increment `flag` to alternate behavior.

### ðŸ§ª Output for your example:
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
k = 3

Steps:
- Reverse [1,2,3] -> [3,2,1]
- Skip [4,5,6] -> [4,5,6]
- Reverse [7,8,9] -> [9,8,7]

Final array:
[3,2,1,4,5,6,9,8,7]
```
âœ… Which matches exactly!

---

### âœ… JavaScript Code:

```
function reverseInAltGroups(arr, k) {
    const n = arr.length;
    let flag = 1; // Flag to check if we are in the reverse group or not
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
        let left = i;
        let right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
        if (flag % 2 !== 0) {
            while (left < right) {
                [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        flag++; // Increment the flag after processing each group
    }
    return arr;
}
console.log(reverseInAltGroups([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 3));

```

### âœ… C++ Code:
```
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void reverseInAltGroups(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int flag = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
        int left = i;
        int right = min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
        if (flag % 2 != 0) {
            // Reverse the current group
            while (left < right) {
                swap(arr[left], arr[right]);
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        flag++;
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    int k = 3;
    
    reverseInAltGroups(arr, k);
    
    for (int num : arr) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    // Output: 3 2 1 5 4

    return 0;
}
```

### ðŸ”¥ Full Marks for:
- Using a `flag` (elegant and simple)
- Correct window movement
- Clean and readable structure

Would you like me to now challenge you with a **slightly harder twist**? ðŸ”¥ (Like dynamic group size?)  
Itâ€™ll be fun and next-level practice! ðŸš€
