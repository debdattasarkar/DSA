# Overlapping Intervals  

## Problem Statement

Given an array of Intervals `arr[][]`, where `arr[i] = [start·µ¢, end·µ¢]`, the task is to merge all of the **overlapping intervals**.

### Example 1:
```
Input: arr[][] = [[1,3],[2,4],[6,8],[9,10]]
Output: [[1,4], [6,8], [9,10]]
Explanation: 
Intervals [1,3] and [2,4] overlap and merge into [1,4].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: arr[][] = [[6,8],[1,9],[2,4],[4,7]]
Output: [[1,9]]
Explanation: 
All intervals overlap with [1,9], so they merge into [1,9].
```

## Constraints
- `1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`
- `0 ‚â§ start·µ¢ ‚â§ end·µ¢ ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`

## Expected Complexities
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## üß† Explanation

### What is an Overlapping Interval?

Two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` **overlap** if `c <= b`.

### Approach:

1. **Sort the intervals** by their starting time.
2. Traverse through the sorted list:

   * If the current interval overlaps with the last one in the result, **merge them**.
   * Otherwise, **add it** as a new interval.

### Input:

```
arr = [[1,3], [2,4], [6,8], [9,10]]
```

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Sort**: `[[1,3], [2,4], [6,8], [9,10]]`
2. Start with `[1,3]`
3. Compare with `[2,4]` ‚Üí Overlap ‚Üí Merge to `[1,4]`
4. Compare with `[6,8]` ‚Üí No Overlap ‚Üí Add `[6,8]`
5. Compare with `[9,10]` ‚Üí No Overlap ‚Üí Add `[9,10]`

### Output:

```
[[1,4], [6,8], [9,10]]
```
