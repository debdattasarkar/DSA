### ‚úÖ Problem Summary: **Stock Buy and Sell (Multiple Transactions)**

Given an array `arr[]` representing stock prices over `n` days, the task is to **maximize profit** by choosing multiple **buy-sell** pairs ‚Äî i.e., buy on a day and sell on a later day, repeatedly.

#### Constraints:

* You can only hold one stock at a time.
* Buy before you sell.
* You can do this multiple times to accumulate profit.

---

### üß† Intuition & Strategy:

You earn profit by buying at a **local minima** and selling at a **local maxima**.
A simpler realization: **every increasing pair contributes to the profit**.

### ‚ûï Key Insight:

If `arr[i+1] > arr[i]`, **buy at `i` and sell at `i+1`**, i.e., add `arr[i+1] - arr[i]` to the profit.

### üß™ Dry Run

```plaintext
arr = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]

Buy at 100, sell at 310 ‚Üí profit = 210
Buy at 40, sell at 695 ‚Üí profit = 655

Total Profit = 210 + 655 = 865 ‚úÖ
