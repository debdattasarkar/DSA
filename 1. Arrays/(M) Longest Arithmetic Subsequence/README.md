```

### Example 2:

Here's a complete explanation and dry run for **Longest Arithmetic Subsequence**, followed by implementations in **Python**, **C++**, and **JavaScript** with inline comments.

## üß† Problem Understanding

We are given a **sorted array of distinct integers**. The task is to **find the length of the longest arithmetic progression (AP)** possible using elements from the array.

### üìå Arithmetic Progression (AP)

A sequence is in AP if the difference between consecutive terms is constant:

```
For example: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] ‚Üí diff = 2
```

---

## ü™ú Step-by-Step Dry Run

Input:

```
arr = [1, 7, 10, 13, 14, 19]
```

Try to find the longest AP:

* Possible AP: \[1, 7, 13, 19] (common difference = 6)
* Length = 4

We use Dynamic Programming:

* Let `dp[i][j]` store the length of the longest AP ending with `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`
* Initialize all values with 2 (every pair has at least length 2)
* Traverse `i < j`, and use formula based on AP properties:

  ```
  arr[i] + arr[k] == 2 * arr[j]  ‚áí  i + k = 2j  ‚áí find if midpoint exists
  ```

* Space optimization (if needed)?

## üîç Observation:

In the original solution, we use a `dp[n][n]` 2D matrix where:

* `dp[i][j]` stores the length of an AP ending with `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`

This takes **O(n¬≤) space**, which is acceptable for `n ‚â§ 1000`, but can be **optimized**.

---

## ‚úÖ Optimization Insight:

For any pair `(i, j)` where `i < j`, the recurrence depends **only on future entries** (`dp[j][k]`) and **not** on past values (`dp[i][j]` is not reused later).

So we can:

* Use a **hashmap per index j** to track the AP length with different differences.
* This brings **space from O(n¬≤) ‚Üí O(n¬∑d)**, where `d` is the number of unique differences (at most O(n)).

## üêç Python (Optimized with HashMap)

from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestAP(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        if n <= 2:
            return n

        dp = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n)]
        max_len = 2

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                diff = arr[i] - arr[j]
                # Extend the AP ending at j with the same diff
                dp[i][diff] = dp[j][diff] + 1 if diff in dp[j] else 2
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][diff])

        return max_len
```

## üí† C++ (Space Optimized Using `unordered_map`)

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int lengthOfLongestAP(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (n <= 2) return n;

        vector<unordered_map<int, int>> dp(n);
        int max_len = 2;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int diff = arr[i] - arr[j];
                dp[i][diff] = dp[j].count(diff) ? dp[j][diff] + 1 : 2;
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][diff]);

# Print the actual AP sequence

Printing the actual **Longest Arithmetic Progression (AP) sequence** along with its **length** requires not only storing the length of APs but also tracking **previous indices** to reconstruct the path.

We will enhance the **space-optimized hashmap-based solution** to also keep a **back-pointer** to each element in the sequence.

---

## üß† Approach Summary

* For each pair `(j, i)` with `arr[i] - arr[j] = diff`:

  * Store not just the length but also the **index** of the previous element.
* After building the DP map, **backtrack** from the index having the longest AP.

---

## üêç Python Code to Print the Longest AP

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestAP(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        if n <= 2:
            return n, arr

        # dp[i][diff] = (length, prev_index)
        dp = [defaultdict(lambda: (1, -1)) for _ in range(n)]

        max_len = 2
        last_index = 0
        last_diff = 0

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                diff = arr[i] - arr[j]
                prev_len, prev_idx = dp[j].get(diff, (1, -1))
                dp[i][diff] = (prev_len + 1, j)

                if dp[i][diff][0] > max_len:
                    max_len = dp[i][diff][0]
                    last_index = i
                    last_diff = diff

        # üîÅ Reconstruct the AP using backtracking
        sequence = []
        idx = last_index
        diff = last_diff
        while idx != -1:
            sequence.append(arr[idx])
            _, prev = dp[idx][diff]
            idx = prev

        sequence.reverse()
        return max_len, sequence


# Example usage
arr = [1, 7, 10, 13, 14, 19]
sol = Solution()
length, sequence = sol.lengthOfLongestAP(arr)
print("Length:", length)
print("Longest AP:", sequence)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Output:

```
Length: 4  
Longest AP: [1, 7, 13, 19]
```

---

## üîç Explanation:

We enhanced `dp[i][diff]` from:

* just storing the **length** ‚ûù to storing both `(length, previous index)`
  This allows reconstructing the sequence after we find the longest one.
