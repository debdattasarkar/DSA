## 📌 Why Are Arrays Important in DSA?

Arrays are:

- **Simple and Efficient** for storing multiple items of the same type.
- **Foundation for Other Data Structures** such as matrices, heaps, and hash tables.
- **Frequently Used** in coding interviews to test logic, iteration, indexing, and problem-solving skills.

Understanding arrays sets the groundwork for mastering more complex data structures and algorithms.
