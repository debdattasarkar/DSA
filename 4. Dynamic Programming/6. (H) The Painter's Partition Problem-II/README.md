### üß† Problem Summary: Painter‚Äôs Partition Problem - II

Given an array `arr[]` where `arr[i]` is the length of the `i-th` board and `k` painters, each taking 1 unit time per unit board length, find the **minimum time** to paint all boards **if each painter can only paint contiguous sections**.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Insight:

We want to **minimize the maximum work assigned** to a painter under the constraint of **contiguous allocation**.

Use **binary search on the answer space** (between max(arr) and sum(arr)) and **greedily check** if `k` painters can paint within the guessed max time.

---

### üßÆ Dry Run Example:

```plaintext
arr = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3

Search space: [30, 80]
Try mid = 55:
- Painter 1 -> 5+10+30 = 45 (ok)
- Painter 2 -> 20 (ok)
- Painter 3 -> 15 (ok) ‚úÖ Works with 3 painters

Try lower: mid = 35:
- Painter 1 -> 5+10 = 15
- Painter 2 -> 30 (ok)
- Painter 3 -> 20+15 = 35 ‚úÖ Just works

Try lower: mid = 34:
- Needs 4 painters ‚ùå

Final answer = 35
```

### üïí Time Complexity:

* Binary search range = `O(log(sum - max))`
* Feasibility check = `O(N)`
* **Overall = O(N \* log(sum))**
